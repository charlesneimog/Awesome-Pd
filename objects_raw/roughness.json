    "description": "The `roughness` object estimates the psychoacoustic roughness of an audio spectrum in real-time, often utilizing the output of `sigmund`. It implements various models for roughness calculation, including those proposed by Plomp & Levelt, Parncutt, Vassilakis, and Sethares, allowing for different psychoacoustic interpretations. It takes frequency and amplitude lists as input to perform its analysis.",
