    "description": "The `phon2db` object converts a loudness value expressed in phons to decibels (dB). It takes a frequency in Hertz (Hz) as an argument, which is crucial for accurate conversion due to the non-linear nature of human hearing perception. This object is useful for working with equal loudness curves and psychoacoustic models.",
