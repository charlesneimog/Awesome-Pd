    "description": "`plaits.m~` is a versatile multi-synthesis engine for Pure Data, wrapping the functionality of Mutable Instruments' Plaits module. It offers a wide array of synthesis models, including physical modeling, granular, additive, and various oscillator types, controllable via signal inputs for frequency, trigger, level, and modulation. The object supports both monophonic and polyphonic operation, with an internal LowPass Gate (LPG) for dynamic shaping in many of its modes.",
