    "description": "The `lookup~` object performs waveshaping distortion by mapping input signal values (from -1 to 1) to indices of an array or table, which acts as a transfer function. It can use any array in Pure Data, including `buffer~` objects (though it only reads the first channel of multichannel buffers), and allows control over the start and end points of the lookup range, even reversing the index scan if the start point exceeds the end point. This enables effects like turntable scratches when scanning audio samples.",
