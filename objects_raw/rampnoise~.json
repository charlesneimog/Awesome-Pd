    "description": "The `rampnoise~` object is a low-frequency, band-limited noise generator that produces \"random ramps\" by interpolating between random values. It outputs signals between -1 and 1, with its frequency controlling the rate of these ramps. The object supports seeding for reproducible output and multichannel operation.",
