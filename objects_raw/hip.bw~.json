    "description": "`hip.bw~` is a highpass Butterworth filter abstraction for Pure Data. It processes an incoming audio signal, allowing frequencies above a specified cutoff to pass through, while attenuating lower frequencies. The filter's characteristics can be adjusted by setting its cutoff frequency and order (from 2 to 100).",
