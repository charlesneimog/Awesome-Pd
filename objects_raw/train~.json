    "description": "The `train~` object generates a pulse signal that alternates between 1 and 0, with configurable period, pulse width, and onset phase offset. It outputs the pulse signal and sends a `bang` message upon each 0-to-1 transition, making it suitable for use as a metronome or for triggering events. The pulse width controls the duration of the \"on\" state, while the onset phase delays the start of the \"on\" portion.",
