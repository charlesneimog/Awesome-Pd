    "description": "The `delay~` object delays an audio signal by a specified number of samples, with the delay time dependent on the sample rate. It supports both fixed and signal-controlled delay times, offering optional interpolation for smooth transitions. This object is fundamental for creating various time-based audio effects, such as flanging or vibrato.",
