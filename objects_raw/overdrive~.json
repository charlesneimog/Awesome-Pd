    "description": "The `overdrive~` object simulates analog tube-based soft clipping, applying a non-linear transfer function to an incoming audio signal to create distortion. A \"drive factor\" controls the intensity of the effect, with values greater than 1 increasing distortion and values less than 1 producing a different type of distortion. Be cautious with drive factors less than 0, as they can lead to very loud output.",
