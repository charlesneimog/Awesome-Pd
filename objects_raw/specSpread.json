    "description": "The `specSpread` object calculates the spectral spread, a measure of the dispersion of the spectrum around its centroid, for an audio signal stored in a Pure Data array. It allows users to specify the analysis window, windowing function, and sample rate, and can also process pre-computed FFT or magnitude spectrum data for efficient chained analysis.",
