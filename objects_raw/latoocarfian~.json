    "description": "`latoocarfian~` is a chaotic signal generator that implements the Latoocarfian difference equations. It produces a chaotic output signal, which can also converge to a single value or oscillate in a cycle, based on configurable coefficients and initial values. This object is useful for generating complex, non-linear audio signals.",
