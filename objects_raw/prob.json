    "description": "The `prob` object generates a weighted series of random numbers based on a first-order Markov chain. It accepts lists of three numbers to define transitions between states and their associated probabilities, and a `bang` to trigger a new state output. The object can also store its internal probability matrix within the patch using the `embed` message.",
