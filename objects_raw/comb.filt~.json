    "description": "The `comb.filt~` object implements a resonator comb filter, which can be configured for decay time (t60) or direct gain feedback. It takes an audio signal and allows control over the filter's resonant frequency and decay characteristics, making it suitable for creating resonant effects and short delays.",
