    "description": "`synth~` is a Pure Data object that simplifies the creation and management of polyphonic or monophonic synthesizers. It acts as a wrapper around `clone`, `mono`, and `voices`, loading synth abstractions and handling voice allocation. It accepts MIDI note messages for pitch and velocity, and allows custom messages to be sent to the loaded synth.",
