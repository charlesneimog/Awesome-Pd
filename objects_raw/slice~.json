    "description": "The `slice~` object splits a multichannel audio signal into two separate signals based on a specified slice point `n`. A positive `n` sends the first `n` channels to the left outlet and the remaining channels to the right, while a negative `n` sends the last `n` channels to the right outlet and the rest to the left. This allows for flexible routing and manipulation of individual channels within a multichannel signal.",
