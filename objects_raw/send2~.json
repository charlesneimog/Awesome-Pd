    "description": "The `send2~` object transmits audio signals to a named receiver, similar to `send~`. Its unique feature is automatically adapting its internal channel count to match the number of input channels it receives. This makes it particularly useful for dynamically routing multichannel audio within a Pure Data patch.",
