    "description": "The `keyboard` object provides an interactive graphical MIDI keyboard within Pure Data, allowing users to generate MIDI note and velocity messages through mouse clicks and drags. It features velocity sensitivity based on click position, a toggle mode for sustained notes, and configurable parameters such as key dimensions, octave range, and velocity normalization. The object can also be controlled programmatically via messages and supports internal communication through send/receive symbols.",
