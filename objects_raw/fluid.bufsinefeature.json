    "description": "The `fluid.bufsinefeature` object performs interpolated sinusoidal peak tracking on the spectrum of audio data stored in a buffer. It analyzes the audio to extract peak frequencies and magnitudes, which can be ordered by frequency or magnitude. This object is useful for detailed spectral analysis and feature extraction from audio signals, supporting multichannel sources.",
