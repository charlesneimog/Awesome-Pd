    "description": "The `fold~` object performs wavefolding, a waveshaping technique that mirrors out-of-bounds signal values back into a specified range. It takes an audio signal as input and folds it between a low and high value, which can be set via signal inlets or messages. This object supports multichannel audio, applying the folding operation across all channels.",
