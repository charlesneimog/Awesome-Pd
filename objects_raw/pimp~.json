    "description": "`pimp~` is a signal generator combining `phasor~` and `else/imp~`, outputting both a phase signal (0-1) and an impulse at each cycle's start. It features phase synchronization, phase modulation, and configurable hard/soft sync, with support for Hertz or MIDI frequency input and multichannel operation. This object is ideal for driving processes with its phase output and triggering events with its impulses.",
