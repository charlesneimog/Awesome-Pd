    "description": "`grain.synth~` is a waveform-based granular synthesizer that generates clouds of pitched grains. It allows control over parameters such as grain duration, size, pitch, amplitude, and panning, and supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes. Users can also define custom grain envelopes and apply tuning scales.",
