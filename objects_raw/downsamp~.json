    "description": "The `downsamp~` object samples and holds an input signal at a specified rate, expressed in samples, without interpolation. It effectively reduces the sample rate of a signal, holding the last sampled value until the next sample is taken. The sampling rate can be controlled by a float or signal, and `mstosamps~` can be used to convert milliseconds to samples for rate control.",
