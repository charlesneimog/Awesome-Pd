    "description": "The `bitor~` object performs a bitwise OR operation on two 32-bit values, either two audio signals or an audio signal and a bitmask. It compares corresponding bits, setting the output bit to 1 if either input bit is 1. The object offers various modes to control how floating-point signals are converted to integers before the bitwise operation.",
