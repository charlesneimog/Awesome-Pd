    "description": "The `bandpass~` object is a 2nd order bandpass resonant filter for audio signals. It allows users to filter a signal by specifying a center frequency and resonance, which can be defined as either 'Q' or bandwidth in octaves. The filter maintains a constant 0dB gain at its resonant frequency and includes options to bypass the input or clear its internal memory.",
