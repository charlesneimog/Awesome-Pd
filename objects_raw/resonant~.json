    "description": "The `resonant~` object is a bandpass resonator filter that allows for control over its center frequency and resonance. Unlike `bandpass~`, its gain increases with higher Q values, enabling it to act as a resonator that sustains sound after the input ceases. Resonance can be set using Q, decay time (t60), or bandwidth (bw).",
