    "description": "`osc.route` is a Pure Data object designed to route Open Sound Control (OSC) messages based on their address patterns. Similar to the `route` object, it directs incoming messages to specific outlets, but it specifically handles OSC's hierarchical address structure, including wildcards and character matching. This allows for flexible and precise dispatching of OSC data within a patch.",
