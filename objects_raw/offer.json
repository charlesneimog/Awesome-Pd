    "description": "The `offer` object stores temporary `x/y` integer pairs. A `y` value is first set in the right inlet, then an `x` value received in the left inlet forms a pair. When an `x` is subsequently received, `offer` outputs its corresponding `y` value and deletes that specific `x/y` pair, acting as a one-time data retrieval mechanism.",
