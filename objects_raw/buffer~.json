    "description": "The `buffer~` object stores and manipulates audio data in memory as a multichannel array, similar to Pd's `table` but with advanced file I/O. It can read and write various audio file formats (WAV, AIFF, CAF), supports up to 64 channels, and offers messages for filling, applying mathematical functions, and dynamic range adjustments. It serves as a core component for sample-based audio processing and playback.",
