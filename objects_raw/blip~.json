    "description": "`blip~` is a band-limited oscillator that generates waveforms by summing cosines, allowing precise control over the fundamental frequency, number of partials, and spectral multiplier. It supports phase modulation and hard/soft sync, making it suitable for creating harmonically rich sounds. This object is based on Csound's 'gbuzz' opcode.",
