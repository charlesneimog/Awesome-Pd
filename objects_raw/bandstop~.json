    "description": "`bandstop~` is a 2nd order band-reject filter, also known as a notch filter, designed to attenuate a specific range of frequencies while allowing others to pass. It calculates filter coefficients based on a center frequency and a resonance parameter (Q or bandwidth in octaves) to precisely shape the audio signal.",
