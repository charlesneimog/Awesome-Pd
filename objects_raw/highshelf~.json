    "description": "The `highshelf~` object implements a 2nd order highshelf filter, designed to modify the high-frequency content of an audio signal. It allows control over the shelving frequency, slope, and gain in decibels, and includes `clear` and `bypass` messages for operational control. Its internal calculations are based on standard biquad filter coefficient formulas.",
