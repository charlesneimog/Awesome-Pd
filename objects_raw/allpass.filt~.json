    "description": "`allpass.filt~` is an allpass filter abstraction that allows setting its order (a multiple of 2) as an argument. It processes an input signal, applying filtering based on a central frequency and resonance (Q) that can be controlled via inlets. This object is built by cascading multiple `allpass.2nd~` objects.",
