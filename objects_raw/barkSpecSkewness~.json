    "description": "The `barkSpecSkewness~` object calculates the skewness of an audio signal's Bark spectrum, quantifying the symmetry of its energy distribution across frequency bands. A positive value indicates more energy in lower frequencies, while a negative value signifies more energy in higher frequencies. This real-time audio descriptor is useful for timbre identification and classification tasks.",
