    "description": "The `dct` object computes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of a specified portion or the entirety of a Pure Data array. It allows for the application of various windowing functions and normalization to the input data. This object is primarily used for analyzing and representing signals in a frequency-like domain, with its output coefficients often serving as spectral descriptors.",
