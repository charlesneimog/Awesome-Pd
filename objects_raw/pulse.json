    "description": "The `pulse` object generates a control-rate pulse wave, similar to the audio-rate `pulse~` object. It can be configured with frequency, pulse width, and an initial phase offset, and its internal phase can be reset. The output can also be toggled, making it suitable for rhythmic control or event generation.",
