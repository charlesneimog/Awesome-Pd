    "description": "The `degrade~` object reduces the quality of an incoming audio signal by manipulating its sampling rate and bit depth. It takes a signal and two control inputs (sample rate from 0-1 and bit depth from 1-24) to produce a resampled and quantized output signal, effectively acting as a bitcrusher.",
