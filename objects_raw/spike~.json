    "description": "The `spike~` object detects zero to non-zero transitions in an audio signal and outputs the time interval in milliseconds since the last detected event. It allows setting a refractory period to control the maximum rate at which these transitions are reported, preventing rapid re-triggering. This makes it useful for event detection and timing analysis in signal processing.",
