## Contributing

Contributions, suggestions and improvements are welcome.

Preferred workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes (edit files under `docs/` for site content or add entries).
3. Submit a pull request with a short description of the change.

If you prefer, you can also use the site’s **Submit** flow (the live site contains a submit link). ([charlesneimog.github.io][1])

Please:

* Add only accurate links and short descriptions for each item.
* Keep categories consistent.
* Prefer upstream/homepage links for each external (not fork mirrors), and indicate installability when possible (e.g., “installable via Pd → Help → Find Externals”).
