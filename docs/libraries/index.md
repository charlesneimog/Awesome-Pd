# Libraries

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- :material-tune: [__else__](else.md) `ELSE` is a big library of externals that extends the performance of Pd.
- :material-tune: [__neimog__](neimog.md) **pd-neimog** is a collection of objects, tools, and integrations for **Pure Data (Pd)** that I use in my work.
- :material-tune: [__zexy__](zexy.md) `zexy` provides several addon objects for the Pd computer music system, including (but not limited to) objects for message handling (construction, parsing, control flow), signal handling (synthesis, analysis, comparison) et al.
- :material-tune: [__pmpd__](pmpd.md) `pmpd` is a collection of objects for Pd (Pure Data), enabling real-time simulations of physical phenomena.
- :material-tune: [__timbreIDLib__](timbreIDLib.md) `timbreIDLib` is a library of audio analysis externals for Pure Data.
- :material-tune: [__cyclone__](cyclone.md) `Cyclone` is a library for Pure Data (Pd) that provides objects mimicking those in Max/MSP.
- :material-tune: [__fftease__](fftease.md) `FFTease` is a collection of objects designed to facilitate spectral sound processing in Max and Pd.
- :material-tune: [__piro__](piro.md) `piro` is Pd-port of `irmeasure~` and `multiconvolve~` from the HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox (HIRT) · Stands for *Pd Impulse Response Objects*, or "fire" (ancient Greek), or sounds like "Pirro" (Pyrrhus) – since this port took a very long period!.
