- :material-tune: [__bend.in__](../objects/bend.in.md) The `bend.in` object in Pure Data extracts MIDI Pitch Bend information from either a connected MIDI device (internal source) or raw MIDI input (external source).
- :material-tune: [__above~__](../objects/above~.md) The `above~` object in Pure Data monitors a signal input and outputs impulses based on a threshold.
- :material-tune: [__dust~__](../objects/dust~.md) The `dust~` object in Pure Data is a pseudo-random impulse generator that outputs positive random impulses (up to 1) according to a configurable density (rate) parameter.
- :material-tune: [__add__](../objects/add.md) The `add` object in Pure Data accumulates input values to a running sum, starting from a configurable initial value (0 by default).
- :material-tune: [__asr~__](../objects/asr~.md) The `asr~` object in Pure Data is an attack/sustain/release envelope generator, simplified compared to `adsr~`.
- :material-tune: [__above__](../objects/above.md) The `above` object in Pure Data monitors a float input and triggers events based on a threshold.
- :material-tune: [__plaits~__](../objects/plaits~.md) `plaits~` is a Pure Data external based on the "Plaits" macro-oscillator module by Mutable Instruments.
- :material-tune: [__abs.pd~__](../objects/abs.pd~.md) The `abs.pd~` object in Pure Data loads a `.pd` file into a subprocess, providing two signal inlets and two signal outlets.
- :material-tune: [__gendyn~__](../objects/gendyn~.md) `gendyn~` implements "Dynamic Strochastic Synthesis" based on Xenakis' GenDyn algorithm.
- :material-tune: [__giga.rev~__](../objects/giga.rev~.md) `giga.rev~` is a stereo reverb in Else based on Juhana Sadeharjuâ€™s *Gigaverb* algorithm, known for producing large, spacious, and dense reverberation tails.
- :material-tune: [__args__](../objects/args.md) The `args` object in Pure Data loads and manages the arguments of an abstraction, allowing them to be queried or changed dynamically.
- :material-tune: [__dispatch__](../objects/dispatch.md) The `dispatch` object in Pure Data takes a list and sends each element to specified receive addresses in left-to-right order.
- :material-tune: [__dir__](../objects/dir.md) The `dir` object in Pure Data is used to access and manage files from directories.
- :material-tune: [__changed~__](../objects/changed~.md) The `changed~` object in Pure Data monitors an input signal and outputs an impulse whenever the signal changes by an amount equal to or greater than a specified threshold.
