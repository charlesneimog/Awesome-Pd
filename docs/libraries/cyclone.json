    "description": "`Cyclone` is a library for Pure Data (Pd) that provides objects mimicking those in Max/MSP.\nIt started as a Max 4.0 clone and has evolved, with updates closer to Max 7.\n`Cyclone` is mainly maintained for bug fixes and backward compatibility, with some objects replaced or supplemented by the `ELSE` library in PlugData.\nIt allows building Max-like patches in Pd, but some newer Max features are not included.",
