    "description": "The `dust~` object in Pure Data is a pseudo-random impulse generator that outputs positive random impulses (up to 1) according to a configurable density (rate) parameter. It can be seeded with a specific integer to reproduce the same sequence or left to generate a unique internal seed. The object supports multichannel outputs, with each channel optionally set to its own density via the `-mc` flag or list input. At high densities, consecutive impulses may occur, and at extreme densities, the output approximates white noise with a DC offset.",
