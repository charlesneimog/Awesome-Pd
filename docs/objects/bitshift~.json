    "description": "`bitshift~` performs bitwise shifting on an incoming signal, moving its bit values to the left or right. The direction and number of shifts are determined by a control input, with positive values shifting left and negative values shifting right. It offers two modes: one that operates directly on the signal's 32-bit floating-point representation and another that first converts the signal to an integer.",
