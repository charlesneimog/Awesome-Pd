    "description": "The `cycle~` object is a linear interpolating oscillator that generates an audio signal by repeatedly reading through a waveform. It can use an internal cosine wave or custom waveforms from Pure Data arrays or `buffer~` objects, with controls for frequency, phase, buffer offset, and size. This object is fundamental for creating periodic audio signals and can be used as a building block for various synthesis techniques.",
