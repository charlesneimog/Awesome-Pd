    "description": "The `highpass~` object is a 2nd order highpass resonant filter designed for audio signals. It allows frequencies above a specified cutoff to pass while attenuating lower frequencies. Its behavior is controlled by setting the center frequency and resonance (Q or bandwidth), and it includes options to bypass the filter or clear its internal memory.",
