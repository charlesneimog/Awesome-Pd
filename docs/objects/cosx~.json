    "description": "The `cyclone/cosx~` object calculates the cosine of an incoming signal, expecting the input values to be in radians. It is designed for mathematical operations on audio signals, distinguishing it from the vanilla `cos~` object which is often used with `phasor~` for waveform generation.",
