    "description": "The `energy~` object from `timbreIDLib` continuously calculates the energy of an audio signal, offering output in power, RMS, or decibels with adjustable window sizing and normalization. It serves as a flexible alternative to `[env~]` for real-time audio analysis, particularly useful for generating features for timbre identification and classification."
