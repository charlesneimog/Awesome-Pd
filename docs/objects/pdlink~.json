  "description": "`pdlink~` allows you to send/receive audio streans to/from different Pd instances, as different versions, platforms and even forks of Pure Data (such as PlugData). It works like `send~`/`receive~` as it just needs a symbol address. It works via network but it's simpler as it doesn't require network configuration! It also allows you to communicate to a `pd~` subprocess. You can make up to 16 sends to a single receive, but you can receive as many times as you like.\n",
