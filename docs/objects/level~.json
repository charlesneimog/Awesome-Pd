  "description": "`level~` is a convenient abstraction for adjusting a signal's gain in dB. At \"12 o'clock\" we have 'Unity Gain\", which is 0 dB. Moving clockwise we linearly up to 12dB, whereas counterclockwise moves nonlinearly to -100, and reaching '-100' effectively means -inf dB (total silence). It has support for multichannel signals.\n",
