# Envelopes

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tune: [__grain.sampler~__](grain.sampler~.md) The `grain.sampler~` object is a sample-based granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from a loaded sample.
- :material-tune: [__grain.live~__](grain.live~.md) `grain.live~` is a live input granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from an incoming signal.
- :material-tune: [__envgen~__](envgen~.md) `envgen~` is a versatile audio envelope and line generator that creates complex amplitude curves based on lists of duration and target values.
- :material-tune: [__grain.synth~__](grain.synth~.md) `grain.synth~` is a waveform-based granular synthesizer that generates clouds of pitched grains.
- :material-tune: [__autofade.mc~__](autofade.mc~.md) The `autofade.mc~` object provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multichannel audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__autofade2.mc~__](autofade2.mc~.md) The `autofade2.mc~` object provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multichannel audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__autofade2~__](autofade2~.md) `autofade2~` is a Pure Data object that provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multiple audio inputs.
- :material-tune: [__asr~__](asr~.md) The `asr~` object generates an attack/sustain/release envelope, acting as a simplified version of `adsr~`.
- :material-tune: [__curve~__](curve~.md) `curve~` is a signal-rate object that generates non-linear (curved) ramp signals, functioning as an envelope generator.
- :material-tune: [__adsr~__](adsr~.md) `adsr~` is an audio-rate Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release envelope generator.
- :material-tune: [__function__](function.md) The `function` object is a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating and manipulating breakpoint functions.
- :material-tune: [__envelope~__](envelope~.md) The `envelope~` object generates various single-cycle envelope waveforms (e.g., sine, Hanning, triangular, Gaussian, trapezoidal) based on a phase input.
- :material-tune: [__ramp~__](ramp~.md) The `ramp~` object generates a linear signal that ramps between a specified minimum and maximum value.
- :material-tune: [__peak~__](peak~.md) `peak~` is a Pure Data signal object that analyzes an incoming audio signal and outputs its peak amplitude.
- :material-tune: [__decay~__](decay~.md) `decay~` is a one-pole filter that generates an exponential decay from input impulses.
- :material-tune: [__envrms~__](envrms~.md) The `envrms~` object is an envelope follower designed for audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__autofade~__](autofade~.md) The `autofade~` object provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multiple audio inputs.
- :material-tune: [__adsr.m~__](adsr.m~.md) The `adsr.m~` object is a polyphonic ADSR envelope generator.
- :material-tune: [__line~__](line~.md) The `cyclone/line~` object generates linear signal ramps or envelopes.
