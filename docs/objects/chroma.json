    "description": "The `chroma` object performs non-real-time pitch chroma analysis on audio data stored in a Pure Data array. It calculates a pitch class profile (chroma vector) for a specified audio segment, configurable by frequency bounds and pitch tolerance. This object can accept pre-computed FFT or magnitude spectrum data via `chain_` messages for optimized analysis workflows."
