    "description": "The `specRolloff` object calculates the spectral rolloff of an audio signal, identifying the frequency below which a specified percentage of the total spectral energy lies. Designed for non-real-time analysis, it processes data from a sample array and can integrate into analysis chains by accepting pre-computed FFT or magnitude spectrum data."
