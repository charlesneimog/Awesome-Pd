    "description": "The `dir` object in Pure Data is used to access and manage files from directories. It can open directories (relative or absolute), reset to the patch\u2019s directory, and reload contents. It outputs the list of files, the current directory path, and the number of files found through its outlets. The `seek` and `next` messages allow indexed or sequential access to files, while `n` reports the total number of files. You can filter results by extension using the `-ext` flag or `ext` message. Directory navigation supports relative paths like `.` (current), `..` (parent), and `~` (home).",
