    "description": "The `balance~` object performs equal-power (sin/cos) stereo balancing. It takes two signal inputs (left and right channels) and a balance value (from -1 for full left to 1 for full right) as a float or signal. The object outputs the balanced stereo signals and supports multichannel output with the `-mc` flag.",
