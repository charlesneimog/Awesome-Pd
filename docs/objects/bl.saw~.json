  "description": "`bl.saw~` is a sawtooth oscillator like `else/saw~`, but it is bandlimited. Use `saw~` mostly if you need a perfect sawtooth, which is usually the case when you want a LFO. The `bl.saw~` version is for proper synthesis as it is anti-aliased. This version also has input for pitch in MIDI and no way to sync at control rate. The object has support for multichannel signals.\n",
