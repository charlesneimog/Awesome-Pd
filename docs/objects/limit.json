    "description": "The `limit` object controls the rate of messages, ensuring a minimum time interval between outputs. It can queue the last received message to be sent after the delay, or, depending on its 'ignore mode' argument, it can discard messages that arrive too quickly, sending them to a separate outlet, or restart its internal timer. This is useful for rate-limiting events or data streams.",
