  "description": "`nyquist~` reports the nyquist (which is half the sample rate) as a frequency or period. It sends it when loading the patch 'init' time (that is before `loadbang`), when receiving a bang or when the sample rate changes. It reports it either in hz or khz and the period either in seconds os milliseconds. like `else/sr~`, it doesn't report up/down sampling rates.\n",
