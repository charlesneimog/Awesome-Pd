    "description": "The `atan2~` object calculates the arctangent of two input signals, 'a' and 'b', as atan(a/b). Unlike a single-argument arctangent, it uses the signs of both inputs to determine the correct quadrant of the resulting angle. This makes it particularly useful for mathematical calculations such as converting Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, specifically for finding the phase.",
