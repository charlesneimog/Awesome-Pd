    "description": "`score2` has a 'tempo' syntax where 'tempo 60' sets the bpm to 60! The 'tempo' messages are output in the third 'data' outlet. You can also set 'tempo 90 3' as in this example and it will accelerate or deaccelerate, going from whatever bpm setting you have to '90' in three beats. When changing the tempo speed, tempo values for each beat are also output.\n",
