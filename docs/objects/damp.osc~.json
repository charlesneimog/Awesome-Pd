    "description": "`damp.osc~` is an abstraction based `reonant2~` and also very very similar to it (to the point I think it wasn't worth having two objects with such subtle differences). It takes frequency in hertz or midi and a decay time in ms. It is triggered by signals at zero to non zero transitions or by lists at control rate.\n",
