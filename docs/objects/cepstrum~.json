    "description": "The cepstrum~ object computes the real cepstrum of an audio signal, derived from the Inverse Fourier Transform of the log magnitude spectrum. It outputs a list of cepstral coefficients, which are commonly used as compact feature vectors for describing audio timbre. This object is primarily used for audio analysis and feature extraction."
