    "description": "The `linedrive` object scales numbers from an input range to an output range using an exponential curve. It is designed to work with objects like `line~` to create non-linear transitions, such as for gain changes. The exponential factor controls the steepness of the curve, with a value of 1 resulting in a linear scale.",
