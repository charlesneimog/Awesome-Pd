    "description": "`autofade2~` is an automatic fade in/out for multi inputs. It responds to a gate control and uses internal lookup tables just like `fader~`. A gate on happens when the last input value was zero or less and the incoming value isn't. A gate off happens when the last value was greater than zero value and the incoming value isn't! The maximum gain depends on the gate on level.\n",
