  "description": "`slew~` takes an amplitude limit per second and an incoming value to be 'slew limited'. It then generates a line towards the incoming value. The difference between `slew~` and `glide~` is that `slew~` has a fixed speed, not a fixed period. A limit of zero stops the line generation and a negative value turns the limiter off. There's support for multichannel signals.\n",
