    "description": "The `asr~` object generates an attack/sustain/release envelope, acting as a simplified version of `adsr~`. It shapes an audio signal based on gate input (signal or bang), with adjustable attack and release times in milliseconds. The object supports various envelope curve shapes (linear, logarithmic, or lag filter) and provides a status outlet indicating its active state, making it useful for dynamic control and multichannel applications.",
