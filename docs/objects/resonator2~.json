  "description": "`resonator2~` is a wrap around `cpole~`. It is very similar to `vcf~`, which is also a wrap around `cpole~`, but has no constant maximum gain at 0dB - so it works like `resonator~` with a constant skirt. Like `resonator~`, it takes a decay time for resonance. Unlike `resonant~`, you shouldn't excite it with noise as the filter produces very high gain output, so it's really suited just to be excited by impulses. By the way, this filter is the basis of `damp.osc~` and `resonbank2~`.\n",
