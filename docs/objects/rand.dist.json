    "description": "`rand.dist` is an abstraction based on `array quantile` and generates random numbers that follow a probability density function (given by an array). A float input (like from an external random source) outputs the array quantile instead. The first argument is the table name containing the probability density function. The output range is from 0 to 127 by default, but you can change that with the 2nd and 3rd argument or the 2nd or 3rd inlet. The output resolution is the range divided by the table maximum index (127 in the example below, so the 0-127 range outputs integers).\n",
