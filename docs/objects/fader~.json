    "description": "The `fader~` object is a waveshaper that applies various mathematical curves to input signals, typically ranging from 0 to 1. It provides seven distinct fading curves, including `quartic`, `sin`, `sqrt`, `hann`, `lin`, and hybrid `hannsin`/`linsin` functions, useful for creating smooth transitions and shaping audio or control signals. It also supports multichannel operation.",
