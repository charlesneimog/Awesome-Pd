    "description": "`brown` is a control brownian motion generator. It is a bounded random walk (based on a pseudo random number generator algorithm). By default, the maximum step is \"0.125\", which is a ratio of the whole range (and the output range is from 0 to 127). If it tries to step outside the bounds, it just gets folded back.\n",
