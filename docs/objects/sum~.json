    "description": "The `sum~` object takes a multi-channel audio signal and sums all its channels into a single mono output signal. By default, it performs this summing operation; however, if a zero is sent to its control inlet, the multi-channel signal passes through unchanged. This object is useful for converting multi-channel audio streams into a mono stream or for conditional summing.",
