    "description": "The `panic` object acts as a \"panic button\" for MIDI notes. It tracks incoming raw MIDI Note-on messages and, upon receiving a `bang`, sends corresponding Note-off messages for any notes that were not explicitly turned off, effectively \"flushing\" hanging notes. It also allows clearing its internal state.",
