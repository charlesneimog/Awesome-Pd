    "description": "The `minSample~` object reports the value and index of the smallest sample within a configurable N-sample window of incoming audio. It handles its own audio buffering, eliminating the need for an external `[block~]` object. The window size can be set at creation or dynamically changed via a \"window\" message, and it does not require a power-of-two size."
