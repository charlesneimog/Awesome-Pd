    "description": "The `bicoeff2` object generates coefficients for Pure Data's native `biquad~` object, allowing users to easily create various filter types such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and shelving filters. It takes parameters like frequency, Q/slope, and gain, simplifying the process of designing biquad filters without manual coefficient calculation. This object acts as a utility to configure `biquad~` for specific filtering needs.",
