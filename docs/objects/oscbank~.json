  "description": "`oscbank~` is a bank made of `sine~` objects. It has a list of partials for each oscillator and a frequency multiplier in the inlet (which can be thought of as the fundamental). If you use flags, the number of elements in the list (such as amplitude list) sets the number of oscillators in the bank, and you must not use regular arguments in this case. There's also support for multichannel output.\n",
