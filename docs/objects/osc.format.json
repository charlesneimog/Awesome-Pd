    "description": "`osc.format` is similar to Vanilla's `oscformat`. This is still way too simple and experimental. It is used in the `osc.send` abstraction and can be used for edge and lower level cases. It takes anything messages or lists whose first element is an address that start with \"/\". The type of data for each element in the message is either a float or a string only depenfing on the atom type, so there are only these options (so far). You can't send bundles either. Use the original Vanilla `oscformat` or mrpeach's packOSC object for more complete objects.\n",
