    "description": "The `scope~` object functions as an oscilloscope display for audio signals in Pure Data. It can operate in a single-channel (Y-mode) to visualize a signal's amplitude over time, or in a two-channel (X-Y mode) to plot one signal against another, useful for visualizing phase relationships and Lissajous figures. Users can configure its display properties, including vertical range, trigger modes, and colors.",
