    "description": "The `zeroCrossing` object calculates the zero-crossing rate of a specified audio array or a segment of it. It can normalize the result by window size and suggests applying an amplitude threshold to filter out noise. This object is designed for offline analysis, with a real-time counterpart `zeroCrossing~`."
