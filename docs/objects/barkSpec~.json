    "description": "The `barkSpec~` object analyzes incoming audio to compute its Bark-frequency spectrum, which warps the normal spectrum to the Bark scale, emphasizing low-frequency detail. It outputs the spectrum as a list of 50 normalized components when triggered, useful for timbre analysis and classification."
