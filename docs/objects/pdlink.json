    "description": "`pdlink` allows you to communicate to/from different Pd instances over local network, as different versions and even forks of Pure Data (such as plugdata). It works like `send`/`receive` (or `else/sender`/`else/receiver`) as it just needs a symbol address. It works via network but it's simpler as it doesn't require network or OSC configuration! It also allows you to communicate to a `pd~` subprocess.\n",
