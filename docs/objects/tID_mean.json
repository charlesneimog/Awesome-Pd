    "description": "The `tID_mean` object calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers. It is designed to summarize time-varying timbre attributes, such as spectral centroid, measured by other `timbreID` externals. This enables the creation of compact, comparable descriptors for sounds of different durations."
