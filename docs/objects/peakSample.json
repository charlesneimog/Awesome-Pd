    "description": "The `peakSample` object analyzes a specified audio array or a segment of it to find the maximum sample value and its corresponding index. It can be triggered to analyze the entire array or a defined window, outputting both the peak value and its relative position within the analyzed segment. This is useful for identifying the loudest point in an audio buffer for offline analysis."
