    "description": "The `saw~` object is a versatile sawtooth wave oscillator that supports negative frequencies, phase synchronization, and phase modulation. It offers flexible frequency input modes (Hertz or MIDI pitch) and can operate in soft sync mode for a less harsh sound. Additionally, `saw~` provides robust multichannel support, allowing for complex polyphonic or layered synthesis.",
