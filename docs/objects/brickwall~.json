    "description": "The `brickwall~` object is a 10th order Butterworth lowpass filter with a very steep cutoff slope (60 dB/octave). It is primarily used as an anti-aliasing filter, especially in upsampling and filtering techniques. Its cutoff frequency can be set via an argument or its second inlet, defaulting to 0.75 times the Nyquist frequency.",
