    "description": "The `index~` object reads values from an array without interpolation, using a signal as the index to read the array. It supports multi-channel arrays (up to 64 channels), allowing a specific channel to be selected via an argument or a float input. This object is primarily designed for direct, non-interpolated access to array data, rather than general sample playback.",
