  "description": "`voices` outputs a list with voice index, pitch, velocity and optional extra stuff. You can set the number of voices with the first argument or '-n' flag, and you can change the number of voices with the \"n\" message, which causes the object to flush and clear its memory. The index offset is 0 by default and you can set a different one with the \"offset\" message or flag.\n",
