# Granular

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tune: [__grain.sampler~__](grain.sampler~.md) The `grain.sampler~` object is a sample-based granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from a loaded sample.
- :material-tune: [__brane.m~__](brane.m~.md) The `brane.m~` object is a comprehensive granulator sampler with stretch/compress capabilities and a harmonizer pitch shifter.
- :material-tune: [__grain.live~__](grain.live~.md) `grain.live~` is a live input granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from an incoming signal.
- :material-tune: [__grain.synth~__](grain.synth~.md) `grain.synth~` is a waveform-based granular synthesizer that generates clouds of pitched grains.
- :material-tune: [__gran.player~__](gran.player~.md) `gran.player~` is a granular audio player that allows for independent time stretching and pitch shifting of loaded sound files.
- :material-tune: [__plaits~__](plaits~.md) The `plaits~` object is a versatile audio synthesizer based on the Mutable Instruments Plaits module, offering 24 distinct synthesis engines.
- :material-tune: [__pitch.shift~__](pitch.shift~.md) `pitch.shift~` is a pitch shifter object that transposes audio signals up or down.
- :material-tune: [__plaits.m~__](plaits.m~.md) The `plaits.m~` object is a versatile polyphonic sound synthesis module, wrapping the `[plaits~]` external.
- :material-tune: [__pvgrain~__](pvgrain~.md) `pvgrain~` is a spectral granulator that tracks an input sound and synthesizes grains based on its spectral characteristics.
- :material-tune: [__stretch.shift~__](stretch.shift~.md) The `stretch.shift~` object performs real-time independent time stretching and pitch shifting on live audio input.
- :material-tune: [__pvoc.live~__](pvoc.live~.md) The `pvoc.live~` object performs independent time stretching and pitch shifting on live audio input using granulation.
