    "description": "The `phasor` object generates a control-rate sawtooth wave, ramping continuously from 0 to 1 at a specified frequency. It functions similarly to the audio-rate `phasor~` but is designed for control signals, with a default rate period of 1ms. It can be initialized with a frequency and phase offset, and its phase can be synchronized via an inlet.",
