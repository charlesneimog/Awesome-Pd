It records or plays mono audio files, offering independent pitch shifting for 'root' and 'harmony' voices, and includes an autotuner that can quantize pitches to any scale, with a built-in equal division scale generator. Additional features include automatic looping, bouncing, freezing, audio slice selection, granular synthesis, random playback settings, and a dedicated preset management system.",
