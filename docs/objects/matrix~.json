    "description": "The `matrix~` object routes and mixes audio signals from multiple inlets to multiple outlets. It supports a \"binary\" mode for simple on/off connections, which can cause clicks, and a \"non-binary\" mode that allows for gain control and ramp times for smoother transitions. When multiple inlets route to the same outlet, their signals are summed.",
