  "description": "`resonator~` is just like `resonant~`, but the resonance parameter is defined as resonance time in 't60'. It has 3 modes, the default is bandpass, which is like `resonant~`, then you can also have lowpass (like `lowpass~`) and highpass (you guessed it, like `highpass~`). Note that a t60 value of 0 bypasses the input! For a bank of `resonator~` objects, see `resonbank~`. For another similar filter, see `resonator2~`.\n",
