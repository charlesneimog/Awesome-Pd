  "description": "`mono.rev~` is a reverb abstraction with mono input but stereo output. It's based on a feedback delay network like vanilla's `rev3~` object, but it offers a \"room size\" parameter whose typical value is around 0.5, values closer to 0 and 1 may create unusual results. Changing size values may generates unusual artifacts (you can clear the delay buffers when you do it to prevent it, but you may get clicks).\n",
