    "description": "The `filterdelay~` object is a high-level audio delay unit that incorporates a resonant lowpass filter, a soft clipper, and a DC filter within its feedback path. It allows for control over delay time, feedback amount, filter cutoff, resonance, and wet/dry mix. The object can also be frozen or cleared, making it suitable for creating complex, filtered echo and reverb-like effects.",
