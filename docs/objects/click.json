    "description": "The `click` object sends a `bang` message when its parent patch (abstraction or subpatch) is clicked. It is primarily used to enable non-graphical abstractions to respond to user clicks, similar to how compiled objects behave. It has an argument to switch between 'abstraction' mode (default, responds to clicks on the abstraction's parent) and 'subpatch' mode (responds to clicks on the subpatch's owner window).",
