    "description": "The `gain2~` object is a stereo gain abstraction for Pure Data, designed to adjust the gain of stereo audio signals. It offers flexible control over gain scaling (quartic, dB, or linear), allows setting a maximum gain, and includes a configurable ramp time for smooth transitions. It also supports MIDI learning for external control and can handle multichannel audio input.",
