    "description": "The `grab` object in Pure Data sends a message to another object and captures its output, routing it through `grab`'s own outlets. It can be configured with a numerical argument to specify the number of outlets, allowing it to grab multiple outputs from a single source. Additionally, `grab` can be linked to a `receive` object via a symbol argument, enabling it to retrieve values from objects connected to that `receive` or even directly from GUI elements, making it useful for data retrieval and preset management.",
