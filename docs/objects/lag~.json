  "description": "`lag~` is a one pole filter that creates an exponential glide/portamento for its signal input changes. The lag time in ms is how long it takes for the signal to converge to within 0.01% of the target value. Note that the rising ramp is different than the descending ramp, unlike `glide~`. the same kind of filter is used in other objects from the ELSE library (decay~/adsr~).\n",
