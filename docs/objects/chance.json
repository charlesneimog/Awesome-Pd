    "description": "The `chance` object outputs a bang to one of its outlets based on a weighted probability distribution. It can be configured with a single percentage for a binary choice or a list of values to define a multi-outlet histogram. This allows for probabilistic routing of events, and its behavior can be made reproducible using a seed.",
