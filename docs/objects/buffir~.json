    "description": "The `buffir~` object is a table/buffer-based Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. It convolves an input signal with samples from a specified buffer, effectively applying the buffer's content as an impulse response. This allows for flexible filtering operations, though it only reads the first channel of multichannel buffers.",
