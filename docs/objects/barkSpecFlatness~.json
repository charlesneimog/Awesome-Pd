    "description": "The `barkSpecFlatness~` object calculates the spectral flatness of an incoming audio signal within the Bark frequency scale, outputting a value between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates how noise-like the spectrum is. This audio descriptor is useful for real-time timbre identification and can be configured with window size and Bark filterbank spacing. It handles its own audio buffering and windowing."
