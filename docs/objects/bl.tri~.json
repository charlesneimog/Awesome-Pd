    "description": "`bl.tri~` is a triangle oscillator like `else/tri~`, but it is bandlimited. Use `tri~` mostly if you need a perfect triangular wave, which is usually the case when you want a LFO. The `bl.tri~` version is for proper synthesis as it is anti-aliased. This version also has input for pitch in MIDI and no way to sync at control rate.\n",
