    "description": "The `order` object splits an incoming list into successive sub-lists of a specified size, assigning an ordered index to each. This utility is particularly useful for distributing individual values or segments of a list to multiple instances of an object, commonly in conjunction with `clone` for parallel processing. It ensures that even partial lists at the end are output.",
