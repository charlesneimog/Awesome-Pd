    "description": "The `allpass.rev~` object functions as an allpass filter, a delay, and a reverberator. It allows setting a delay time and a reverberation/decay time (t60), which measures the time for an impulse to fall 60dB in energy. Alternatively, it can operate in a \"gain mode\" where the decay is controlled by a gain coefficient.",
