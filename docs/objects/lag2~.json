    "description": "The `lag2~` object smooths incoming signals, allowing for independent ramp-up and ramp-down times. It's similar to `lag~` but offers separate control over how quickly a signal rises to a target value versus how quickly it falls. This is useful for creating portamento effects or smoothing control signals.",
