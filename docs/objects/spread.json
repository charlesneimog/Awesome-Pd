    "description": "The `spread` object routes incoming lists to different outlets based on a comparison of the list's first element to a set of arguments. Similar to `moses`, it provides conditional routing but offers multiple comparison arguments and an additional mode for splitting lists. This allows for flexible distribution of data based on numerical thresholds.",
