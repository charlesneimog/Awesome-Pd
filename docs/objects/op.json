    "description": "The `op` object in Pure Data performs a wide range of arithmetic, comparative, logical, and bitwise operations. It is particularly useful for processing lists, applying the chosen operation element-wise and handling mismatched list sizes by wrapping the shorter list. The desired operation can be specified as an argument or message, with `+` as the default.",
