    "description": "`slew2~` is like `slew~` but has independent values for upwards & downwards ramps. It takes an amplitude limit per second and generates a line towards the incoming value. The difference between `slew~` and `glide~` is that `slew~` has a fixed speed, not a fixed period. A limit of zero stops the line generation and a negative value turns the limiter off (but again, up and down limits are independent).\n",
