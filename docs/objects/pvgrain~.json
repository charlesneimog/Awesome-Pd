    "description": "`pvgrain~` is a spectral granulator that tracks an input sound and synthesizes grains based on its spectral characteristics. It allows control over parameters such as grain duration, frequency range, and the probability of grain generation per FFT frame. The object is designed for audio processing and assumes a 44100 Hz sample rate.",
