    "description": "`nchs~` gets the number of channels from a multi-channel connection, as provided by `snake~ in`, `clone` or other objects. The object outputs values whenever the DSP chain gets updated and you can also query for the number of channels with a bang message. It also works in subpatches or abstractions because `inlet~` is also multi-channel aware.\n",
