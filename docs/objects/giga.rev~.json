    "description": "`giga.rev~` is a stereo reverb in Else based on Juhana Sadeharju\u2019s *Gigaverb* algorithm, known for producing large, spacious, and dense reverberation tails. It offers controls for decay time, room size, damping, bandwidth, and early/late reflections, along with a dry/wet balance, making it flexible for anything from subtle ambience to cathedral-like spaces. The object comes with presets for quick setup and, while more CPU-intensive than simpler reverbs, it delivers smooth, natural decays with a wide stereo image, making it especially useful for ambient, cinematic, and experimental sound design.",
