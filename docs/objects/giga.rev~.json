    "description": "The `giga.rev~` object implements a Gigaverb-based reverberation algorithm, transforming a mono audio input into a stereo output. It offers extensive control over room characteristics, including size, decay time, high-frequency damping, input bandwidth, and the levels of dry, early, and late reflections, as well as stereo spread. This allows for simulating various acoustic spaces from small rooms to large canyons.",
