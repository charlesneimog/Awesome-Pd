    "description": "`pm6.m~` is a six-operator FM (phase modulation) synthesizer, inspired by the DX7, producing stereo output. It takes MIDI pitch input and allows control over each operator's level, ratio, and panning, as well as a modulation index matrix for feedback and feedforward modulation. It also features a master level control and pitch transposition.",
