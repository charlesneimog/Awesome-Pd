    "description": "The `number~` object in Pure Data functions as a dual-mode signal utility: it can either monitor an incoming audio signal, displaying its value, or generate a signal with a user-defined ramp time. Users can switch between these modes via a bang message or by interacting with its graphical interface. This object is deprecated; for signal monitoring, `[sig~]` and `[cyclone/snapshot~]` are recommended, while `[else/numbox~]` offers a more comprehensive GUI for signal generation and monitoring.",
