    "description": "`polymetro` is a polyrhythmic metronome. Polyrhythms are better specified with fractions, but you can set it as floats, which is a tempo multiplier value in the end. The left output is a counter for the base tempo count while the right outlet is the relative count/tempo as specified by the multiplier ratio. This is an abstraction based on synced `clock` objects.\n",
