    "description": "`gray~` generates noise based on \"gray code\" or reflected binary code (RBC), which results from flipping random bits (sot is is based on a pseudo random number generator algorithm.). \"Gray Code\" is named after Frank Gray, the owner of the patent of gray codes. This type of noise has a high RMS level relative to its peak to peak level. The spectrum is emphasized towards lower frequencies. It has support for multuchannels.\n",
