    "description": "The `specKurtosis` object calculates the spectral kurtosis of an audio array, serving as a non-real-time spectral descriptor. It can analyze a specified window or the entire array, with configurable windowing functions, sample rates, and spectrum types (magnitude or power). A key feature is its ability to accept pre-computed FFT or magnitude spectrum data via `chain_` messages for efficient chained analysis workflows."
