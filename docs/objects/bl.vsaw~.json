    "description": "`bl.vsaw~` is a variable sawtooth waveform oscillator that also becomes a triangular osccilator just like `else/vsaw~`, but it is bandlimited. Use `vsaw~` mostly if you need a wave form, which is usually the case when you want a LFO. The `bl.vsaw~` version is for proper synthesis as it is anti-aliased. This version also has input for pitch in MIDI and no way to sync at control rate.\n",
