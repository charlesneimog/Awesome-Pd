- :material-tune: [__pix_delay__](pix_delay.md) The `pix_delay` object creates a frame-based delay line for images, allowing a series of images to be delayed.
- :material-tune: [__fbdelay~__](fbdelay~.md) The `fbdelay~` object creates a feedback delay line, useful for delay effects, reverberation, and comb filtering.
- :material-tune: [__pipe2__](pipe2.md) The `pipe2` object functions similarly to Pure Data's vanilla `pipe` object, delaying incoming messages.
- :material-tune: [__echo.rev~__](echo.rev~.md) `echo.rev~` is an echo/reverb abstraction designed to produce early reflections in a reverb algorithm or function as a standalone effect.
- :material-tune: [__trig.delay2~__](trig.delay2~.md) The `trig.delay2~` object delays an incoming impulse signal by a specified time in milliseconds.
- :material-tune: [__del~__](del~.md) The `del~` object in Pure Data manages audio delay lines.
- :material-tune: [__ping.pong~__](ping.pong~.md) The `ping.pong~` object is an audio effect that creates a ping-pong delay.
- :material-tune: [__z~__](z~.md) The `z~` object provides a sample-wise delay for audio signals, effectively implementing a `z^-N` delay.
- :material-tune: [__teeth~__](teeth~.md) The `teeth~` object implements a comb filter, processing an audio signal with independent feedforward and feedback delays.
- :material-tune: [__filterdelay~__](filterdelay~.md) The `filterdelay~` object is a high-level audio delay unit that incorporates a resonant lowpass filter, a soft clipper, and a DC filter within its feedback path.
- :material-tune: [__delay.m~__](delay.m~.md) `delay.m~` is an audio effect object that functions as a wrapper for the `filterdelay~` object from the ELSE library.
- :material-tune: [__gatehold~__](gatehold~.md) The `gatehold~` object holds an incoming gate signal for a specified duration in milliseconds after the gate closes.
- :material-tune: [__revdelay~__](revdelay~.md) The `revdelay~` object creates a reverse delay effect.
- :material-tune: [__ffdelay~__](ffdelay~.md) The `ffdelay~` object provides a simple feed-forward audio delay with interpolation.
- :material-tune: [__comb~__](comb~.md) The `comb~` object implements a comb filter, an audio effect that combines a signal with a delayed version of itself to create a series of regularly spaced notches or peaks in the frequency response.
- :material-tune: [__comb.rev~__](comb.rev~.md) The `comb.rev~` object implements a comb filter, functioning as a versatile audio effect for creating delays, reverberation, and resonant textures.
- :material-tune: [__gatedelay__](gatedelay.md) The `gatedelay` object delays the "on" message of a control gate by a specified time in milliseconds, while passing the "off" message immediately.
- :material-tune: [__allpass~__](allpass~.md) The `allpass~` object implements an all-pass filter, which passes all frequencies without altering their gain but changes their phase.
- :material-tune: [__allpass.rev~__](allpass.rev~.md) The `allpass.rev~` object functions as an allpass filter, a delay, and a reverberator.
- :material-tune: [__comb.filt~__](comb.filt~.md) The `comb.filt~` object implements a feedback comb filter, designed primarily for use as a resonator.
- :material-tune: [__delay~__](delay~.md) The `delay~` object delays an audio signal by a specified number of samples.
