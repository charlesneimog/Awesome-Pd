  "description": "`resonbank2~` is a bank of resonators made of `resonator2~` objects. The design and structure here is different than `resonator2~` in order to make it better suited for sound synthesis. It has the same design as `resonbank~` and has a list of partials for each resonator and a frequency multiplier in the left inlet, kinda like `oscbank~`. The mid inlet the trigger (or excitation) signal (kinda like `pluck~`) - this must be an impulse since noise sources and noise bursts generate very loud outputs! The rightmost inlet is a time multiplier for the decay times. The number of filters is set via the parameter list size (such as the partial list). There's also support for multichannel output.\n",
