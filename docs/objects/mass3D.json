    "description": "The `mass3D` object simulates a mass in a 3D space, calculating its position and velocity based on applied forces, weight, damping, and boundary conditions. It outputs the mass's current X, Y, Z position, velocity, and total applied force, making it suitable for physical modeling and interactive simulations.",
