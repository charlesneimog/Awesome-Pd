    "description": "`notedur2ratio` converts from a note duration symbolic syntax to a ratio (either as fraction or float). The syntax is: '1n' for whole note, '2n' for half note, '4n' for quarter note, '8n' for eighth note (and so on down to 128n). Dotted notes are possible and you can add tuplets to the symbol in the `x:y` format or you can add the following letters to specify most common tuplets: 'd' for duplet, 't' for triplet, 'q' for quintuplet, 's' for septuplet and 'n' for nonuplet. Tied notes are also possible with \"_\". Details in the examples below.\n",
