    "description": "The `equals~` (or `==~`) object performs a signal-level comparison. It outputs a signal of `1` when its left inlet's signal is equal to the signal or float provided to its right inlet or as an argument, and `0` otherwise. This object is primarily used for conditional logic based on signal equality within a patch.",
