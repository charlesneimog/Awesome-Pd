    "description": "The waveSlope object analyzes the slope of a waveform stored in a Pure Data array. Designed for offline analysis, it provides a measure of waveform change over time. Users should be aware that low-amplitude sections can yield erratic results, suggesting the use of an amplitude threshold for cleaner data."
