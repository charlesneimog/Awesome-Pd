    "description": "The `toggleff~` object is a signal-rate toggle switch that outputs either 0 or 1. It flips its output state (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) whenever its input signal crosses from non-positive to positive, acting as a trigger. It can be initialized with an argument to set its starting output state.",
