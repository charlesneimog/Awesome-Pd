    "description": "The `midiparse` object receives raw MIDI data, typically from `midiin`, and parses it into various MIDI messages. It outputs note messages (pitch/velocity), polyphonic aftertouch, control change (value/controller number), program change, channel aftertouch, and pitch bend messages, along with the MIDI channel. It also supports a `@hires` attribute for setting pitch bend precision.",
