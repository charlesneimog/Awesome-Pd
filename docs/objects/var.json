    "description": "The `var` object in Pure Data functions as a variable storage mechanism, similar to `value`, but with the added capability to manage multiple named variables, including lists. It allows setting and recalling values for these variables, which are shared with `value` objects and can be accessed within `expr` objects. Values are typically assigned to `var` objects via `send` messages or other sending mechanisms from objects like `float`, `int`, or `value`.",
