    "description": "The `bitor~` object performs a bitwise OR operation on two audio signals or a signal and a 32-bit integer bitmask. It compares the 32-bit floating-point representations of its inputs, setting output bits to 1 if either corresponding input bit is 1. The object supports various modes for converting floating-point inputs to integers for the bitwise operation.",
