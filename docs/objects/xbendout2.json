    "description": "The `xbendout2` object formats 14-bit pitch bend messages into two 7-bit values (MSB and LSB) and sends them as a raw MIDI data stream. It takes the MSB, LSB, and an optional MIDI channel as input. Note that this object is considered redundant and deprecated, with `bendout` or `else/bend.out` being preferred alternatives.",
