    "description": "The `sah~` object samples and holds an input audio signal based on a trigger signal. When the trigger signal rises above a specified threshold, `sah~` captures the current value of the input signal and continuously outputs it. This held value persists until the trigger signal again crosses the threshold after having dropped below it, effectively synchronizing one signal to the behavior of another.",
