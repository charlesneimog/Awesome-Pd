    "description": "The `pimp` object is a control-rate signal generator, analogous to `phasor~` but operating at a control rate with a maximum resolution of 1 ms. It generates a periodic signal based on an input frequency in Hertz and an initial phase offset. It also provides an inlet for phase synchronization and can output a bang at each period transition.",
