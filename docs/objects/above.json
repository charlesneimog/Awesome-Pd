    "description": "The `above` object in Pure Data monitors a float input and triggers events based on a threshold. It sends a bang from its left outlet when the input rises above the set threshold, and a bang from its right outlet when the input falls back to or below the threshold. The threshold can be set as an argument when creating the object or via its second inlet. The object primarily handles floats as input and is useful for detecting crossings of a specific value in control or signal data.",
