  "description": "`trapezoid~` is a trapezoidal wavetable that is read with phase values from 0 to 1 into the first inlet, so a `phasor~` input turns it into a wavetable oscillator. A second and third inlet change the position of ramp up/down points. The default lo/hi values are 0 and 1, but may be changed using the lo/hi messages or attributes to any given range.\n",
