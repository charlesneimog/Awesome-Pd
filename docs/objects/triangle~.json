    "description": "The `triangle~` object generates a variable-duty triangle waveform at signal rate. It uses a phase input (0-1) to read its internal wavetable, effectively creating an oscillator when driven by a `phasor~`. The second inlet controls the peak position, allowing for waveforms ranging from sawtooth to symmetric triangles, and its output range can be adjusted via `lo` and `hi` messages.",
