    "description": "`triangle~` is a triangular wavetable that is read with phase values from 0 to 1 into the first inlet- a `phasor~` input turns it into a wavetable oscillator. A second inlet changes the position of the peak value (variable duty, from 0 to 1), going from sawtooth like waveforms to triangular ones. The default lo/hi points are -1 and 1, but may be changed using the lo/hi messages to any given range.\n",
