    "description": "`note2midi` converts note names (such as 'C4') to MIDI pitch values. All enharmonic names are included (even unusual ones like Cb and double sharps/flats). There's also support for quarter tones (syntax is '+' for quarter tone sharp and '-' for quarter tone flat). It takes symbols, lists or anythings that end with an octave number, in a way that C4 represents middle C (MIDI pitch = 60). Octave range is from '0' to '8'.\n",
