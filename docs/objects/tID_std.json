    "description": "The tID_std object calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers, requiring at least two elements. It is primarily used to summarize time-varying timbre attributes, such as spectral centroid or flatness, measured by other timbreID externals. This allows for the comparison of spectro-temporal characteristics between sounds of varying durations by reducing complex time-series data into a single, compact descriptor."
