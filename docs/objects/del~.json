    "description": "The `del~` object in Pure Data manages audio delay lines. When instantiated as `del~ in`, it defines and writes a signal to a delay line, allowing control over its size and freezing. When instantiated as `del~ out`, it reads from a defined delay line with cubic interpolation, enabling flexible audio delays.",
