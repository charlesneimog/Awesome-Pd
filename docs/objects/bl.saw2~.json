  "description": "`bl.saw2~` is a sawtooth oscillator like `else/saw2~`, but it is bandlimited. Use `saw2~` mostly if you need a perfect sawtooth, which is usually the case when you want a LFO. The `bl.saw2~` version is for proper synthesis as it is anti-aliased. This version also has input for pitch in MIDI and no way to sync at control rate.\n",
