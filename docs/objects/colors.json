  "description": "`colors` can output color values specially for Pd Vanilla's GUI objects (aka iemgus) and Data Structures. In recent versions of Pd, the iemguis also understand colors with hex notation, which should be the best practice way to work with colors in these objects nowadays. But `colors` can also set to the particular and old iemgui float format.\n",
