  "description": "`play.file~` reads/plays files from your computer similarly to Vanilla's `readsf~`, but it supports more file formats (officialy AAC, AIF, CAF, FLAC, MP3, OGG, OPUS & WAV). It can also browse and play files from web links! Note that the file sample needs to be at the same sample rate as Pd's.\n",
