    "description": "The `abs.pd~` object in Pure Data loads a `.pd` file into a subprocess, providing two signal inlets and two signal outlets. It allows sending messages to the subprocess, starting it with `start <symbol>`, stopping it with `stop`, and opening its GUI with a click or the `show` message. If given a symbol argument, it automatically loads and starts the subprocess with DSP enabled; otherwise, it can be started manually. It also supports receiving MIDI data from devices connected to the parent process.",
