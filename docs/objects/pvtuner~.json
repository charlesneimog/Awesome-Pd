    "description": "`pvtuner~` is a frequency-quantized oscillator bank resynthesis object that allows users to impose arbitrary tunings. It supports custom scales defined by lists of frequencies, can interpolate between different scales, and features transposition and a synthesis threshold. It can also set a base frequency using a MIDI note.",
