    "description": "The `specSlope` object calculates the spectral slope of an audio sample, quantifying the average decrease in amplitude across increasing frequencies. It operates on a specified audio array, typically after spectral analysis, and is useful for characterizing the brightness or darkness of a sound's timbre."
