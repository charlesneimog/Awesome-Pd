    "description": "`osc.route` routes OSC messages received from `osc.receive`. It follows the same logic as Vanilla's `route` where arguments set the number of outlets and an extra is created for no matches. The difference is that it manages OSC addresses instead, specified with the \"/\" separator. Note how the '/hz' address matches input messages that start with '/hz' even if it has further sub addresses.\n",
