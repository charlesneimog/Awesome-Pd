    "description": "The `osc.route` object routes incoming Open Sound Control (OSC) messages based on their address patterns. Similar to Pure Data's `route` object, it uses arguments to define specific OSC addresses to match, directing messages to corresponding outlets, with an additional outlet for unmatched messages. It supports OSC wildcard characters for flexible pattern matching.",
