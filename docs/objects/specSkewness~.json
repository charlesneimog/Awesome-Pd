    "description": "The `specSkewness~` object calculates the spectral skewness of an audio signal, providing a measure of the asymmetry of its spectral envelope. A positive value indicates more energy in lower frequencies, while a negative value suggests more energy in higher frequencies. It handles its own audio buffering and windowing, making it suitable for real-time spectral analysis and feature extraction for timbre classification."
