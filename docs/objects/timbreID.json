    "description": "The timbreID object stores, clusters, and classifies audio feature vectors, enabling tasks like sound identification and timbre ordering. It performs nearest-neighbor searches and hierarchical clustering on incoming feature data. This object is particularly useful for real-time concatenative synthesis and analyzing large datasets of pre-recorded audio."
