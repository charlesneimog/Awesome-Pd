    "description": "The `makenote2` object converts a list of pitch, velocity, and duration into MIDI note-on and note-off messages. It supports symbolic pitches (e.g., 'C4') and allows additional data in the input list, which can be passed to the note-off message. Duration is specified in beats, with the BPM configurable via an argument or inlet, allowing for millisecond durations if BPM is set to 60.000.",
