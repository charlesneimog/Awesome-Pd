    "description": "`sequencer` sends an element from a given sequence when banged. Elements joined by \"-\" are sent at the same time but separately (allowing chords). A single \"-\" is treated as a rest. A \"_\" is ignored and can be thought as \"tie\". A \"|\" represents a barline. Symbol elements are sent without a symbol selector (and can be note names or anything else). A \"bang\" comes out as a proper \"bang\".\n",
