    "description": "The `attackTime~` object calculates the attack time of an audio event in milliseconds. Upon receiving a bang, it identifies the peak sample within its analysis window and then searches backward for the attack onset, defined by a period of near-silence. This object requires an external onset detector to trigger its analysis and outputs the attack time, onset, and peak sample indices."
