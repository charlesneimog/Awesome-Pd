    "description": "`adsr~` is an attack/decay/sustain/release gated envelope. The attack/decay/release times are set in ms. A gate on sets the maximum attack peak, the sustain point is a ratio of the gate on value. A gate off sets the release - but note that, by default, if the gate off comes before the sustain point is reached, the attack+decay stages still get completed before going into the release ramp. Another mode allows an immediate release. The object has multichannel support.\n",
