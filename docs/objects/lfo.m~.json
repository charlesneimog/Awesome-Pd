    "description": "`lfo.m~` is a low-frequency oscillator module that generates various waveforms including sine, triangle, saw, vsaw, and square. It features signal inlets for frequency modulation (FM) and pulse width modulation (PWM) with attenuverters, and a sync inlet for impulse-based synchronization. The object can also output unipolar signals.",
