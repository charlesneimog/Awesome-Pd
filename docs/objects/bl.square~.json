    "description": "`bl.square~` is a square oscillator like `else/square~`, but it is bandlimited. Use `square~` mostly if you need a perfect square wave, which is usually the case when you want a LFO. The `bl.square~` version is for proper synthesis as it is anti-aliased. This version also has input for pitch in MIDI and no way to sync at control rate.\n",
