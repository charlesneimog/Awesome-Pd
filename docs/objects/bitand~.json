    "description": "The `cyclone/bitand~` object performs a bitwise AND operation on two incoming signals or a signal and a given bitmask. It converts floating-point audio signals to 32-bit integers for the comparison, offering various modes for handling input conversion. This object is useful for low-level signal manipulation based on bit patterns.",
