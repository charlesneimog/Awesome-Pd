    "description": "The `slice~` object splits a multichannel signal into two outputs based on a specified split point. A positive split point `n` sends the first `n` channels to the left outlet and the rest to the right, while a negative `n` sends the last `n` channels to the right outlet. If the number of channels is less than the split point, the entire signal is routed to one outlet, with the other outputting zeros.",
