# Sequencers

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tune: [__store__](store.md) The `store` object is an abstraction built upon Pure Data's `text` object, designed for sequential storage and management of messages.
- :material-tune: [__rec__](rec.md) The `rec` object records incoming messages across multiple tracks and plays them back.
- :material-tune: [__drum.seq__](drum.seq.md) The `drum.seq` object provides a graphical drum sequencer for creating and playing drum patterns.
- :material-tune: [__score__](score.md) The `score` object is a Pure Data score sequencer that uses a custom text-based syntax to define musical events.
- :material-tune: [__euclid__](euclid.md) The `euclid` object implements the Euclidean rhythm algorithm, which distributes a given number of "hits" as evenly as possible over a specified number of "steps".
- :material-tune: [__seq8.m~__](seq8.m~.md) The `seq8.m~` object is a simple 8-step sequencer for Pure Data, designed to generate musical sequences.
- :material-tune: [__phaseseq~__](phaseseq~.md) `phaseseq~` is a signal-rate object that generates impulses when an incoming phase signal crosses a predefined list of threshold values.
- :material-tune: [__seq__](seq.md) The `seq` object in Pure Data is a MIDI sequencer that can play, record, load, and save MIDI streams to and from MIDI or text files.
- :material-tune: [__list.seq__](list.seq.md) The `list.seq` object sequences through elements of a given list, outputting one element at a time upon receiving a `bang`.
- :material-tune: [__counter__](counter.md) The `counter` object in Pure Data increments or decrements an integer value within a specified range.
- :material-tune: [__impseq~__](impseq~.md) The `impseq~` object generates a sequence of impulses.
- :material-tune: [__mtr__](mtr.md) The `mtr` object in Pure Data functions as a multi-track message recorder and playback system.
- :material-tune: [__polymetro~__](polymetro~.md) `polymetro~` is a polyrhythmic metronome for signal rate that outputs impulses.
- :material-tune: [__sequencer__](sequencer.md) The `sequencer` object in Pure Data plays back a user-defined sequence of elements, advancing one step per `bang`.
- :material-tune: [__pattern__](pattern.md) The `pattern` object is a rhythmic pattern sequencer that outputs note durations based on a defined sequence.
- :material-tune: [__score2__](score2.md) The `score2` object is a sequencer that plays back musical scores using a rhythmic notation syntax similar to `pattern`.
- :material-tune: [__sequencer~__](sequencer~.md) The `sequencer~` object outputs values from a predefined sequence when triggered by a signal (0 to non-0 transition) or a bang.
