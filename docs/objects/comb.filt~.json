    "description": "The `comb.filt~` object implements a feedback comb filter, designed primarily for use as a resonator. It processes an audio signal by adding a delayed and attenuated version of itself, creating a series of notches and peaks in the frequency response. Parameters include delay time (in Hz or milliseconds) and a decay coefficient, which can be set as a 60dB decay time (t60) or a direct gain value.",
