    "description": "The `tempo~` object estimates the tempo (BPM) of an incoming audio signal. It employs spectral growth analysis for onset detection, a Harmonic Product Spectrum (HPS) algorithm, and mode analysis of recent tempo estimates to provide a stable result. Users can optimize accuracy by defining tempo and frequency ranges, making it suitable for signals with stable tempos and sharp transients, albeit with significant latency."
