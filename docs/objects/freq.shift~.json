    "description": "The `freq.shift~` object is a frequency shifter, not a pitch shifter, that operates via complex amplitude modulation. It takes an audio signal and a frequency shift value as input. The left outlet outputs the frequency-shifted signal, while the right outlet provides a signal shifted in the opposite direction, similar to a second sideband in ring modulation.",
