    "description": "`sr~` can set the sample rate and also reports the sample rate frequency or period when loading the patch, when receiving a bang or when it changes. It also outputs the value at 'init' time (that is before `loadbang`). The frequency is reported either in hz or khz and the period either in seconds os milliseconds. Unlike `samplerate~`, it doesn't report up/down sampling rates. The default output is the sample rate frequency in hertz.\n",
