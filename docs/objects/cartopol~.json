    "description": "The `cartopol~` object converts a complex signal from Cartesian coordinates (real and imaginary parts) to polar coordinates (amplitude and phase). It is primarily used in spectral processing workflows, often in conjunction with `poltocar~`, to transform signals for operations like FFT and iFFT. Connecting only the amplitude output can save CPU resources.",
