    "description": "The `susloop~` object generates a control signal for reading audio buffers, specifically designed for sustained looping of a section. It responds to gate inputs (float or signal) to trigger, stop, pause, or continue playback, and allows setting loop points and playback speed. This object is typically used in conjunction with sample playback objects like `tabread4~`.",
