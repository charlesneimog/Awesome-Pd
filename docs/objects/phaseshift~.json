    "description": "The `phaseshift~` object is a 2nd order allpass filter that alters the phase of an audio signal without changing its gain. It shifts the phase from 0 degrees at 0 Hz to 360 degrees at the Nyquist frequency. The filter's frequency parameter sets the point where the phase shifts to 180 degrees, and the Q parameter controls the steepness of this phase shift.",
