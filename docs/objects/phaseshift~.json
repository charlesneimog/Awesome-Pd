    "description": "`phaseshift~` is a 2nd allpass filter, which keeps the gain and only alters the phase from 0 (at 0 hz) to 360\u00ba (at the Nyquist frequency). The frequency at which it shifts to 180\u00ba is specified as the filter's frequency (minimum 1o hz) and the steepness of the curve is determined by the Q parameter - see graph below.\n",
