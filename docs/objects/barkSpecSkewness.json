    "description": "The `barkSpecSkewness` object calculates the skewness of the Bark spectrum of an audio sample. It analyzes a specified portion of an audio array, providing a statistical measure of the asymmetry of its spectral energy distribution across Bark frequency bands. It can also process pre-computed spectral data to optimize analysis."
