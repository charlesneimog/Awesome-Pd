  "description": "`resonbank~` is a bank of resonators made of `resonator~` objects. The design and structure here is different than `resonator~` in order to make it better suited for sound synthesis. It has a list of partials for each resonator and a frequency multiplier in the left inlet, kinda like `oscbank~`. The mid inlet the trigger (or excitation) signal (kinda like `pluck~`) and the rightmost inlet is a time multiplier for the decay times. The number of filters is set via the parameter list size (such as the partial list). There's also support for multichannel output.\n",
