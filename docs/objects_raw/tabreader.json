    "description": "`tabreader` is a Pure Data object that reads values from an array (table) using various interpolation methods, including spline, cosine, linear, and Hermite. It supports multichannel arrays and can operate in indexed or loop modes. When driven by a `phasor~`, `tabreader` functions as a low-frequency wavetable oscillator, making it suitable for waveform generation and sample playback.",
