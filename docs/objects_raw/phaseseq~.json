    "description": "`phaseseq~` is a signal-rate object that generates impulses when an incoming phase signal crosses a predefined list of threshold values. It functions as a phase-based sequencer, outputting an impulse and the index of the triggered threshold each time a value is reached. This allows for precise rhythmic or event triggering within a cycle.",
