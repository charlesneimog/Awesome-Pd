    "description": "The `rdiv~` object, also known as `!/~`, performs division on audio signals. Unlike the standard `/~` object, `rdiv~` reverses the inlet functions, dividing a number (from the right inlet) by the incoming signal value on the left inlet. It is useful for specific signal processing scenarios where this reversed division order is required.",
