    "description": "The `sampleBuffer~` object buffers incoming audio, providing a windowed segment of the audio stream for real-time analysis. It is particularly useful for inspecting the exact audio frame processed by analysis objects like `timbreID`. Its window size can be set at creation or dynamically changed, and it handles its own buffering without requiring `block~`."
