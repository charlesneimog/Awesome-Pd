    "description": "`mtx.mc~` is a Pure Data object designed for routing and mixing multichannel audio signals. It allows users to direct a specific channel from a multichannel input to one or more channels of a multichannel output, with adjustable gain and a configurable ramp time for smooth transitions. It's ideal for dynamic re-patching of audio streams within a multichannel setup.",
