    "description": "The `triangle~` object generates a variable-duty triangular wavetable. It takes a phase input (typically from a `phasor~`) to produce a continuous waveform, and a second inlet controls the peak position (duty cycle) from 0 to 1, allowing it to morph between sawtooth and triangular shapes. Its output range can be adjusted using `lo` and `hi` messages.",
