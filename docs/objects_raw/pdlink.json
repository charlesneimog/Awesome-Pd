    "description": "The `pdlink` object enables simplified communication between different Pure Data instances, including `[pd~]` subprocesses, over a local network. It functions like `[send]` and `[receive]` for inter-patch messaging, but extends this capability across separate Pd applications without requiring explicit network or OSC configuration. It uses a symbol as an address for sending and receiving data.",
