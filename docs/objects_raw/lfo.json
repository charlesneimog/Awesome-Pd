    "description": "The `lfo` object is a control-rate Low Frequency Oscillator that generates various waveforms including sine, triangle, sawtooth, and variable square/sawtooth. It allows control over its frequency, initial phase, and refresh rate, outputting a float value typically in the range of 0-127. This object is useful for modulating parameters at sub-audio rates.",
