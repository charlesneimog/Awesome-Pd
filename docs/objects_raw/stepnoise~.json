    "description": "The `stepnoise~` object generates band-limited, stepped noise, producing pseudo-random values between -1 and 1 at a specified frequency. It acts as a low-frequency noise generator without interpolation, creating discrete \"steps\" rather than smooth transitions. The output can be made reproducible using a seed, and the object supports multichannel operation.",
