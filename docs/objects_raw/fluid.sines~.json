    "description": "The `fluid.sines~` object performs sinusoidal modeling on an audio input, attempting to reconstruct the signal as a bank of sinusoids. It outputs both the resynthesized sinusoidal components and a residual signal. This object is useful for analyzing and manipulating the harmonic content of sounds, particularly those with stable or oscillating pitches.",
