    "description": "The `keymap` object translates computer keyboard presses into MIDI note on/off messages, mapping keys to specific pitches across two rows (e.g., 'z' row for C3, 'q' row for C4). It supports octave shifting and transposition, and can operate in a 'toggle' mode for sustained notes. This object is primarily used to control synthesizers or other MIDI-aware modules directly from the computer keyboard.",
