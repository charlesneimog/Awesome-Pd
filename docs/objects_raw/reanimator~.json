    "description": "The `reanimator~` object performs audio texture mapping by analyzing a \"texture\" sound using spectral analysis (FFT) and then re-synthesizing audio based on a \"driver\" sound. It features an internal oscillator bank for synthesis, allowing for transposition and control over synthesis parameters like threshold and playback speed.",
