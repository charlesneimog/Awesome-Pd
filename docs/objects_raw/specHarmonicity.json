    "description": "The `specHarmonicity` object calculates the spectral harmonicity and inharmonicity of an audio sample. It analyzes the spectral content, optionally using a provided fundamental frequency, to quantify how closely the partials align with a harmonic series. This object is primarily used for extracting timbral descriptors from audio."
