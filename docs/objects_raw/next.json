    "description": "The `next` object in Pure Data detects whether an incoming message is part of the same \"logical event\" as the previous one. It outputs a bang from its left outlet if the message is a new event (e.g., a single mouse click or a delayed message), and a bang from its right outlet if it's part of the same event (e.g., multiple bangs from an `uzi` object). This is useful for triggering actions once per distinct message dump or event stream.",
