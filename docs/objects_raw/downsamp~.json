    "description": "The `downsamp~` object performs a sample-and-hold operation on an input audio signal, effectively reducing its sample rate. It takes a signal in the left inlet and a rate (in samples) in the right inlet, without performing any interpolation on the output. This can be used to create aliasing effects or to simulate lower fidelity audio.",
