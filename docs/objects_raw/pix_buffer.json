    "description": "`pix_buffer` is a named storage object for images, functioning similarly to a table but without direct visual access to its contents. It can store images of varying dimensions and color spaces, dynamically allocating memory or pre-allocating it via the `allocate` message. Images can be written to or read from the buffer using associated objects like `pix_buffer_write` and `pix_buffer_read`, and it supports loading from and saving to files.",
