    "description": "The `clock` object sends bangs at a regular tempo, acting as a 'main' clock or a 'synced' clock. A main clock controls other synced clocks with a relative tempo, allowing for synchronized timing across a patch. It can be set to a specific BPM or a multiplier for synced clocks, and can also be synced to a `metronome` object.",
