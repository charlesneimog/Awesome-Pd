    "description": "The `damp.osc~` object is a damped harmonic motion oscillator that generates audio signals. It accepts frequency (in Hz or MIDI pitch) and a decay time in milliseconds as inputs. The object can be triggered by zero-to-non-zero signal transitions or control-rate lists, providing both cosine and sine phase outputs.",
