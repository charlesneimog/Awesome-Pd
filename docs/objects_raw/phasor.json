    "description": "The `phasor` object generates a control-rate ramp signal, similar to `phasor~` but for control signals rather than audio. It can be configured by frequency in Hz or by a rate period in milliseconds, and its phase can be offset or synced. It outputs a phase value scaled from 0 to 127, making it suitable for MIDI or other control parameter modulation.",
