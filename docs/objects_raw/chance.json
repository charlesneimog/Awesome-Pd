    "description": "The `chance` object outputs a bang to one of its outlets based on a set of probabilities. These probabilities can be configured with a single float for two outlets (e.g., 50% chance for the left, 50% for the right) or a list of floats for multiple outlets. It supports seeding for reproducible random sequences, making it useful for introducing controlled randomness into patches.",
