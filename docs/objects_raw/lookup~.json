    "description": "The `lookup~` object performs a signal-rate table lookup, mapping input signal values (typically from -1 to 1) to indices within a specified array. It is primarily used for waveshaping, where an array acts as a transfer function to distort an input signal. Additionally, it can be employed for creative sample manipulation, such as scanning through audio samples to create effects like turntable scratches.",
