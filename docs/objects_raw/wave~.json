    "description": "The `wave~` object reads audio data from a specified array (wavetable) using a phase signal (0-1) as an index. It offers seven different interpolation modes, including linear, cosine, cubic, and Hermite, allowing for precise control over playback quality. Additionally, `wave~` supports setting custom start and end points within the array and can handle multichannel audio up to 64 channels.",
