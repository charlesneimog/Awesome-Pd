    "description": "The autoCorrPitch~ object calculates the fundamental pitch of an incoming audio signal using autocorrelation, converting the result to Hertz and MIDI units. It is designed for real-time pitch tracking and can be used as a feature extractor for timbre identification. Users can adjust the analysis window size to optimize accuracy and the range of detectable frequencies.",
