    "description": "The `teeth~` object functions as a comb filter, offering independent control over feedforward and feedback delay times, along with their corresponding gain coefficients. It processes an input signal by applying these delays and gains to produce a filtered output, utilizing linear interpolation for sub-sample delay times.",
