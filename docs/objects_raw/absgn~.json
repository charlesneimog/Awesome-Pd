    "description": "The `absgn~` object calculates the absolute value and the signum of an incoming audio signal. It takes a signal as input and outputs two signals: one for the absolute value and another for the signum. This object is part of the `zexy` library and is an abstraction, meaning an external version might offer better performance.",
