    "description": "The `tID_fft~` object computes the complex Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of an audio signal, triggered by a bang. It outputs the real and imaginary components of the FFT as two separate lists, handling internal audio buffering and windowing. This object is designed for extracting frequency-domain features, particularly useful for timbre identification and classification tasks.",
