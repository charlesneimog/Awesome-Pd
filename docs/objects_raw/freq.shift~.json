    "description": "The `freq.shift~` object performs frequency shifting on an input signal, displacing all its frequency components by a specified amount in Hertz. Unlike a pitch shifter, it does not preserve harmonic relationships. It provides two outputs: the frequency-shifted signal and an oppositely shifted signal, and can clear its internal memory.",
