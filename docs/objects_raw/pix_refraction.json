    "description": "The `pix_refraction` object processes an input image by dividing it into rectangular cells and scaling the image content within each cell. This creates a visual effect similar to viewing the image through a wall of glass bricks, where each brick acts as a magnifying or shrinking lens. It allows control over the scaling amount, cell dimensions, and whether expansion beyond the original size is prevented.",
