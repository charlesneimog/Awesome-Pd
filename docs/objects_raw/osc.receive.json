    "description": "The `osc.receive` object is used to receive Open Sound Control (OSC) messages over network connections. It acts as an abstraction built upon `osc.parse` and `netreceive`, allowing it to connect to a specified port to receive messages, typically from an `osc.send` object. It can be controlled to connect or disconnect from a port, and outputs the received OSC messages.",
