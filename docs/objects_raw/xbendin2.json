    "description": "The `xbendin2` object parses incoming raw MIDI data to extract the Most Significant Byte (MSB) and Least Significant Byte (LSB) of pitch bend messages, which can be combined to form a 14-bit value. It also outputs the MIDI channel number and can filter messages by channel. This object is considered redundant and deprecated, with `bendin` or `else/bend.in` being recommended alternatives.",
