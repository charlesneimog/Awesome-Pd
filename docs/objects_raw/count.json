    "description": "The `count` object acts as a versatile counter, incrementing or decrementing a numerical value within specified minimum and maximum bounds. It can be reset, have its current value set, and its direction (up/down) or alternating mode controlled via messages. A `bang` input triggers the count, and it outputs the current count value, along with a `bang` when it reaches its limits.",
