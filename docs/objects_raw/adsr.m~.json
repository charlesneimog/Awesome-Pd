    "description": "The `adsr.m~` object is a polyphonic ADSR envelope generator designed for multichannel audio signals. It takes gate input in its left inlet and can be retriggered by impulses or a `bang` message. Attack, decay, and release times are specified in milliseconds, while the sustain point is a ratio of the gate input, with additional audio CV controls for these parameters.",
