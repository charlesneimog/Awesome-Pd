    "description": "The `svfilter~` object implements Chamberlin's state-variable filter, providing simultaneous lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch (bandstop) outputs. It takes an audio signal, a cutoff/center frequency, and a Q/resonance value as inputs, allowing for dynamic control over the filter characteristics. A `clear` message can be sent to reset the filter.",
