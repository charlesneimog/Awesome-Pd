    "description": "The `compress~` object is an audio compressor that attenuates an input signal when its amplitude exceeds a specified threshold. It allows control over parameters such as threshold (in dB), attenuation ratio, attack and release times (in ms), output gain, and RMS averaging size. This object is used for dynamic range processing of audio signals.",
