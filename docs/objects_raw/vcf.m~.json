    "description": "`vcf.m~` is a single-channel lowpass filter module. It processes an audio input, allowing control over its cutoff frequency (in Hz) and resonance (Q factor). The filter's cutoff and resonance parameters can be modulated via dedicated control voltage (CV) inlets, which are influenced by attenuverter controls.",
