    "description": "The `iterate` object splits an incoming message (typically a list of floats or symbols) into its individual elements and outputs them sequentially. It can be triggered by a `bang` to re-output the last received list, and its direction of iteration can be controlled. An optional `-trim` flag allows trimming symbol selectors from the output.",
