    "description": "The `lores~` object implements an inexpensive resonant lowpass filter, designed to shape audio signals by attenuating frequencies above a specified cutoff. Its cutoff frequency and resonance can be controlled via inlets, allowing for dynamic filter sweeps. Users can send a 'clear' message to reset its internal state, which is helpful for managing its recursive filter behavior.",
