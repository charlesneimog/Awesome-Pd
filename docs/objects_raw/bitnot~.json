    "description": "`bitnot~` performs a bitwise NOT operation (one's complement) on an incoming signal. It inverts all bits of the 32-bit floating-point signal, with an option to first convert the input to an integer. This object is useful for low-level signal manipulation and can be a building block for more complex digital signal processing.",
