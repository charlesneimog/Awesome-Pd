    "description": "The `bitnot~` object performs a bitwise NOT operation (one's complement) on an incoming audio signal, inverting all bits of its 32-bit representation. It offers two modes: one that operates directly on the floating-point signal's bit representation, and another that first converts the signal to an integer before inversion.",
