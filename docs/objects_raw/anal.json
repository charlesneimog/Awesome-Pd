    "description": "The `anal` object calculates and stores transition probabilities between sequences of numbers, primarily for implementing Markov Chains. It reports how many times a number pair has been received, outputting the previous number, current number, and their occurrence count. This is useful for generating less random-sounding sequences in algorithmic composition, often used as input for objects like `cyclone/prob`.",
