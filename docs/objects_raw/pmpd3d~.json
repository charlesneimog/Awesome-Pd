    "description": "The `pmpd3d~` object is a 3D particle-based physical modeling engine designed for audio synthesis. It enables users to construct and interact with a system of masses and links, defining their physical properties such as weight, position, rigidity, and damping. The object supports real-time control through messages and audio signals, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the physical model to generate sound.",
