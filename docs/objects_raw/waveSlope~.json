    "description": "The `waveSlope~` object calculates the slope of the best-fit line through the absolute value of audio samples within a configurable analysis window. It outputs this slope when triggered, enabling segmentation of sound events into attack, decay, and sustain phases based on amplitude changes. This descriptor can be used as a feature for real-time timbre classification.",
