    "description": "The `specBrightness~` object calculates the spectral brightness of an audio signal, defined as the ratio of high-frequency spectral magnitudes to total spectral magnitudes. It allows setting the window size, boundary frequency, and windowing function, and can use either magnitude or power spectrum. This descriptor is useful for analyzing the timbral characteristics of sounds, particularly their perceived \"brightness.\""
