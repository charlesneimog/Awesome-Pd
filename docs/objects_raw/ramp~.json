    "description": "The `ramp~` object generates a linear signal that ramps between a specified minimum and maximum value. It can be configured with an increment, a reset point, and various modes (wrap, clip, reset) to control its behavior upon reaching boundaries. This versatile object is useful for creating envelopes, controlling playback speed for sample reading (e.g., with `tabread4~`), or even constructing basic oscillators.",
