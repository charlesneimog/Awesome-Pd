    "description": "The `ramp~` object generates a linear signal ramp between user-defined minimum and maximum values, automatically looping or clipping based on its mode. It is highly versatile, functioning as a control signal for tasks like driving `tabread4~` for sample playback at variable speeds, or as a basic oscillator similar to `phasor~`.",
