    "description": "The `sequencer` object in Pure Data plays back a user-defined sequence of elements, advancing one step per `bang`. It supports various data types including numbers, symbols, and lists (for chords), and special markers for rests, ties, and barlines. This versatile object is ideal for generating rhythmic and melodic patterns, providing distinct outputs for sequence elements, rests, end-of-sequence, and bar numbers.",
