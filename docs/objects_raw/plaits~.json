    "description": "`plaits~` is a versatile Pure Data object based on Mutable Instruments' Plaits module, offering 24 distinct synthesis engines. It generates a wide array of sounds, from physical modeling and granular textures to classic waveforms and FM synthesis, often featuring a built-in Low-Pass Gate (LPG) for dynamic shaping. The object takes pitch, trigger, and level inputs, with extensive modulation capabilities for its 'Harmonics', 'Timbre', and 'Morph' parameters.",
