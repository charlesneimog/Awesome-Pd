    "description": "The `keypress` object detects presses of a single computer keyboard key, outputting either a `bang` or a toggle (1 for pressed, 0 for released). It can be configured with a specific key symbol or dynamically \"learn\" a key press, saving it as an argument. The object filters out auto-repeated key presses and those made in edit mode, making it suitable for interactive control.",
