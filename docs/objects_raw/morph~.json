    "description": "The `morph~` object performs a spectral crossfade between two input audio signals, `A` and `B`, by interpolating their amplitudes and phases. This allows for dynamic cross-synthesis and spectral morphing, creating smooth transitions or hybrid sounds based on control signals for the interpolation amount.",
