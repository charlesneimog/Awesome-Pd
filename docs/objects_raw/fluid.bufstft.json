    "description": "The `fluid.bufstft` object performs forward and inverse Short-Time Fourier Transforms (STFT) on single-channel audio buffers. It is used for spectral analysis, allowing for the extraction of magnitude and phase information, and subsequent resynthesis of audio signals. This object is fundamental for tasks like spectral processing, visualization (spectrograms), and various forms of spectral synthesis.",
