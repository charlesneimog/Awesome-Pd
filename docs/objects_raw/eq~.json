    "description": "The `eq~` object is a 2nd order parametric equalizer filter, capable of functioning as both a peak and a notch filter. It processes an input signal, allowing precise control over its frequency content through adjustable central frequency, resonance (Q or bandwidth), and gain in decibels. It also provides `clear` and `bypass` messages for control.",
