    "description": "The `latoocarfian~` object is a chaotic audio signal generator that implements the Latoocarfian attractor's difference equations. It produces a continuous audio signal whose behavior is determined by four coefficients (a, b, c, d) and initial x and y values. The output rate of the chaotic signal can be controlled in Hertz.",
