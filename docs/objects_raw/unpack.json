    "description": "The `unpack` object splits an incoming message or list into its individual atoms, sending each atom to a separate outlet. Similar to Pure Data's built-in `unpack` object, the number and type of expected atoms are defined by its creation arguments. This object is useful for deconstructing structured data into its constituent parts for further processing.",
