    "description": "The `pack2` object combines incoming data from its inlets into a single list, similar to `pack`. Unlike `pack`, any input triggers an output, unless a 'set' message is used to store values without outputting. It dynamically adjusts its number of inlets based on initialization and can handle both float and symbol types.",
