    "description": "The `presets` object in Pure Data manages and stores the state of other objects, particularly those connected to `receive` or `receiver` objects. It allows users to save, load, clear, import, and export patch configurations to files. Additionally, it features morphing and interpolation capabilities for smooth transitions between saved preset values, and integrates with `savestate` for managing abstraction states.",
