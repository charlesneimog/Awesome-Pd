    "description": "The `sampstoms~` object converts a time value from samples to milliseconds, taking the current sample rate into account. It accepts both float and signal inputs representing the number of samples. A float input produces both float and signal outputs in milliseconds, while a signal input only produces a signal output. This object is useful for tasks like setting period times for objects such as `train~`.",
