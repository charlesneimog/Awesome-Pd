    "description": "`bl.square~` is a bandlimited square wave oscillator designed for proper audio synthesis, preventing aliasing. It offers control over pulse width, phase offset, and phase synchronization, and can accept frequency input in either Hertz or MIDI pitch. The object also supports multichannel operation, allowing for multiple square waves from a single instance.",
