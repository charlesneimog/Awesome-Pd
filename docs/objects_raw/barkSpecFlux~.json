    "description": "The `barkSpecFlux~` object calculates the spectral flux of an audio signal based on Bark-band energy differences. It outputs the sum of these differences (left outlet) and the full list of per-band differences (right outlet). This object is useful for real-time timbre identification and basic attack detection, offering configurable windowing, Bark filterbank spacing, and analysis window separation.",
