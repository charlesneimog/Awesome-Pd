    "description": "The `sfz~` object is a Pure Data synthesizer that plays SFZ instruments, which are text-based definitions for sample-based and hybrid synthesis. It interprets `.sfz` files to arrange and play samples, and can also generate sounds using internal oscillators and apply effects like filters and envelopes. It supports extensive MIDI control for performance and microtonal tuning.",
