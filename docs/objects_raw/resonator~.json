    "description": "The `resonator~` object acts as a resonant filter, controlled by a central frequency and a t60 resonance time. It offers bandpass (default), lowpass, and highpass modes. Designed to be excited by an impulse signal, it can generate oscillator-like sounds or simulate physical modeling.",
