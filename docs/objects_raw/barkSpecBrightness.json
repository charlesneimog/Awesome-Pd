    "description": "The `barkSpecBrightness` object calculates the brightness of an audio sample by analyzing its Bark spectrum. It takes an audio array, filterbank spacing, and a Bark boundary point as arguments to customize the spectral analysis. This object is designed for efficient descriptor extraction within signal processing chains, capable of accepting pre-computed FFT, magnitude, or Bark spectrum data."
