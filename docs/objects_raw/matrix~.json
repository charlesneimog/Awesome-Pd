    "description": "The `matrix~` object functions as a signal routing and mixing matrix, enabling dynamic redirection of audio signals from multiple inlets to various outlets. It supports both a \"binary\" mode for simple on/off connections and a \"non-binary\" mode that allows for precise gain control and ramp times, facilitating smooth transitions and crossfades. This object is essential for complex audio signal flow management within a patch.",
