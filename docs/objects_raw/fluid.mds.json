    "description": "The `fluid.mds` object performs Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for dimensionality reduction on a `fluid.dataset`. It is used to analyze and visualize high-dimensional data, such as MFCCs from audio buffers, by projecting them into a lower-dimensional space. The object also allows for comparison of various distance metrics during the scaling process.",
