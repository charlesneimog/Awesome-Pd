    "description": "The `peek~` object provides direct, non-interpolated access to Pure Data arrays (tables) for both reading and writing values via messages. Unlike typical signal-rate objects, it operates independently of the DSP status, making it suitable for control-rate manipulation of array data, including support for multichannel arrays.",
