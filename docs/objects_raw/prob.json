    "description": "The `prob` object generates a weighted series of random numbers, functioning as a 1st-order Markov chain. It defines transitions between states using lists of three numbers: `value1`, `value2`, and `weight`. A bang triggers the output of the next state based on the defined probabilities, and its probability matrix can be embedded within the patch for persistence.",
