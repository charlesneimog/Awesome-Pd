    "description": "`randpulse2` is a random pulse train oscillator that generates pulses (0 or 1, or random values between -1 and 1) at random intervals. Its behavior is controlled by a 'density' parameter, which influences the average frequency of the pulses. The object also supports seeding for reproducible random sequences.",
