    "description": "The `comb.rev~` object implements a general-purpose comb filter, which can be used to create delay, comb filtering, or reverberation effects. It processes an input signal `x[n]` to produce an output `y[n]` based on a configurable delay time `D` and gain coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` for input, feedforward, and feedback paths respectively. The object supports dynamic control of delay time and coefficients via signal or float inputs.",
