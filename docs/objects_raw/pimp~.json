    "description": "The `pimp~` object is an impulse oscillator that combines the functionality of `phasor~` and `else/imp~`. It outputs a phase signal and generates an impulse at the start of each phase period, supporting both hard and soft synchronization. It can be controlled by frequency in Hertz or MIDI pitch, and supports multichannel operation for complex signal generation and modulation.",
