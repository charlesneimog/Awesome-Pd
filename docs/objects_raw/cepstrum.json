    "description": "The `cepstrum` object computes the cepstrum of an audio signal from a specified sample array. It allows for analysis of a defined window of samples, offering options for various windowing functions and the choice between magnitude or power cepstrum. This object is designed for non-real-time audio feature extraction and can integrate into analysis chains by accepting pre-computed FFT or magnitude spectrum data."
