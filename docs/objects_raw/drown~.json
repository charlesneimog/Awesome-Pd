    "description": "The `drown~` object performs spectral noise floor manipulation on audio signals using FFT. It allows for reducing or increasing the energy of individual FFT bins based on a per-bin amplitude threshold and a gain factor. This object is useful for adaptive noise reduction or spectral enhancement.",
