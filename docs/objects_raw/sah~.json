    "description": "The `sah~` object samples an input signal when a trigger signal crosses a specified threshold, then holds that sampled value until the trigger crosses the threshold again. It effectively synchronizes one signal's value to the events of another, acting as a sample-and-hold for audio signals. It is best used with impulse-like trigger signals rather than continuous ramps.",
