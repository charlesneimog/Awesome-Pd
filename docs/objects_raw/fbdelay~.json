    "description": "`fbdelay~` implements a simple feedback delay line, useful for creating delay effects, reverberation, and comb filtering. It allows control over delay time and feedback, which can be set via a \"t60\" decay time (time for impulse to fall 60dB) or directly as a gain coefficient. The object supports interpolation for sub-sample delay times and features options to set maximum delay size, clear the buffer, and freeze the delay line.",
