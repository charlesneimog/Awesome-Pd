    "description": "The `overdrive~` object simulates analog overdrive by applying a non-linear transfer function to an incoming audio signal, mimicking the soft clipping of a tube-based circuit. It takes an audio signal and a \"drive factor\" as input, producing a distorted output signal. Increasing the drive factor intensifies the distortion.",
