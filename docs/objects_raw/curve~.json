    "description": "`curve~` generates non-linear, curved ramp signals, offering an exponential curve factor to shape the transition between values. It functions similarly to `cyclone/line~` but produces curved rather than linear ramps. This object is useful for creating dynamic control signals, such as Attack-Release envelopes, by defining destination values, durations, and a curve factor ranging from -1 to 1.",
