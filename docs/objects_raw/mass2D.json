    "description": "The `mass2D` object simulates a 2D mass, calculating its position and velocity based on applied forces, weight, and damping. It allows setting initial positions, boundary limits (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax), and can reset its state or stop/start movement. This object is useful for creating interactive physical simulations within Pure Data.",
