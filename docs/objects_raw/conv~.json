    "description": "The `conv~` object performs partitioned convolution, primarily used for applying impulse responses to audio signals. It takes an input audio signal and convolves it with a specified impulse response, which is loaded from a table. Users can set the impulse response table and adjust the partition size for latency and performance trade-offs.",
