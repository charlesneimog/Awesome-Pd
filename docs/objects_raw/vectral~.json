    "description": "The `vectral~` object smooths or filters frame-based signal data, such as the output of an `fft~` object, primarily for visualization purposes. It offers three modes—linear ramp (`rampsmooth`), logarithmic ramp (`slide`), or minimum step change (`deltaclip`)—to control how changes between frames are processed. Additionally, it can \"bin-shift\" incoming vectors based on input and output index synchronization.",
