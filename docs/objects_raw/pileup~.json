    "description": "The `pileup~` object performs spectral persistence by maintaining amplitude and phase information in frequency bins. It can resynthesize audio using an oscillator bank, allowing for control over low/high frequencies, transposition, and a synthesis threshold. It also features options for spectral \"feedback\" and various persistence modes (amplitude/phase, amplitude only, inverse).",
