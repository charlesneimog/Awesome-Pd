    "description": "The `peakSample~` object identifies the sample with the largest magnitude within a defined window of an incoming audio signal, outputting both its value and index. It handles its own audio buffering and windowing, making it suitable for real-time audio feature extraction. This descriptor is particularly useful as an input for timbre identification and classification systems."
