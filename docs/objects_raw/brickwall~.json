    "description": "The `brickwall~` object is a 10th-order Butterworth lowpass filter primarily designed for anti-aliasing. It applies 16x oversampling to effectively remove high-frequency components from a signal. Its cutoff frequency can be controlled via its second inlet, defaulting to 0.75 times the global Nyquist frequency.",
