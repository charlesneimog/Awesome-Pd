    "description": "`pm6~` is a 6-operator FM (frequency modulation, specifically phase modulation) synthesizer. Each operator is a sine wavetable oscillator that can modulate itself and others, allowing for complex sound generation. It provides extensive control over each operator's frequency ratio, detuning, panning, and volume, along with a comprehensive modulation matrix for inter-operator modulation.",
