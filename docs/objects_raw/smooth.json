    "description": "The `smooth` object in Pure Data is designed to smoothly interpolate control signals over a specified time in milliseconds, preventing abrupt changes. It can apply either linear or exponential curves to these transitions, effectively creating a portamento or glide effect for control values. This is useful for making control changes sound less jarring, such as when changing the frequency of an `osc~` object.",
