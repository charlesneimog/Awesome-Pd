    "description": "The `pm6.m~` object is a 6-operator phase modulation (FM) synthesizer, inspired by the Yamaha DX7, producing stereo audio. It allows users to configure a modulation matrix for self-feedback, feedforward, and feedback modulation, along with individual oscillator ratios, levels, and panning. It accepts MIDI pitch input and can be modulated by external signals like envelopes for dynamic control.",
