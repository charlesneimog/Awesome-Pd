    "description": "`brown~` is a brown noise generator, also known as Brownian or red noise, which produces a signal whose spectral energy drops 6dB per octave. It operates as a bounded random walk, generating new steps based on a pseudo-random number algorithm, and allows for custom step sizes and seed values for reproducible sequences.",
