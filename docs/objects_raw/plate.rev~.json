    "description": "`plate.rev~` is a stereo plate reverb abstraction based on Dattorro's model, designed for adding reverberation to mono audio signals. It provides control over parameters such as pre-delay, filter cutoff, high-frequency damping, room size, and wet/dry mix. This object is suitable for simulating realistic or stylized reverberant spaces.",
