    "description": "The `metronome` object generates rhythmic pulses based on a specified tempo, beat length, and time signature, including support for complex and irrational time signatures. It outputs a bang at each beat, a phase value (0-1), and a list of bar, sub-bar, beat, and sub-beat counts, making it suitable for precise rhythmic control and event sequencing. It can also operate in a subdivision mode, banging at sub-tempos.",
