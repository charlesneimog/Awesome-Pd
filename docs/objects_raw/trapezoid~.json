    "description": "`trapezoid~` generates a trapezoidal waveform. It functions as a wavetable oscillator when fed a phase signal (0-1) into its first inlet, typically from a `phasor~`. The shape of the trapezoid can be dynamically adjusted via its second and third inlets, which control the ramp up and ramp down points, respectively, while `lo` and `hi` messages set the output amplitude range.",
