    "description": "`randpulse~` is a random pulse train oscillator that generates a signal alternating between a random value and zero, with configurable pulse width. It supports multichannel operation, allowing independent control over frequency, pulse width, and phase synchronization for each channel. The object also features a seeding mechanism for its pseudo-random number generator, enabling reproducible random sequences.",
