    "description": "The `link` object calculates forces between two masses, simulating a physical connection with configurable rigidity and damping. It outputs the forces to be applied to each mass, enabling the creation of dynamic physical simulations. The object supports non-linear behaviors based on minimum and maximum link lengths, allowing for attractive or repulsive forces.",
