    "description": "`resonbank2~` is a bank of resonant filters designed for sound synthesis, similar to `oscbank~` but focused on resonance. It takes an impulse excitation signal, a frequency multiplier, and a decay time multiplier to shape the sound. The object allows for dynamic control over its resonant filters through lists of partials, decay times, and amplitudes, and supports multichannel output.",
