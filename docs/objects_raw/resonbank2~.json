    "description": "`resonbank2~` is a bank of resonant filters designed for sound synthesis. It takes an impulse-like excitation signal and applies it through multiple resonators, allowing control over their frequencies (via partials), decay times, and amplitudes. It supports multichannel output, where each resonator can be routed to a separate channel.",
