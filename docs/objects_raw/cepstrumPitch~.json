    "description": "The `cepstrumPitch~` object performs real-time pitch tracking of an audio signal using cepstrum analysis. It is specifically designed to detect the fundamental frequency within a user-defined MIDI pitch range, outputting the result in MIDI units. This object handles its own audio buffering and windowing, and can be configured with parameters like window size and a peak detection threshold."
