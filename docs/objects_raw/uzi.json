    "description": "The `uzi` object generates a specified number of bangs and a corresponding counter value for each bang, executing its loop as fast as possible. It provides outlets for each bang, the current counter value, and a final bang upon loop completion. `uzi` is useful for iterating through sequences, such as array indices, and can be paused, resumed, or reset via messages.",
