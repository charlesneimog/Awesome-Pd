    "description": "The `uzi` object generates a sequence of bangs and corresponding counter values, useful for iterating through a specified number of steps. It outputs a bang from its left outlet for each step, a float representing the current count from its right outlet, and a final bang from its middle outlet upon completion. Control messages like `pause`, `resume`, and `offset` allow for flexible loop management, making it ideal for tasks such as array indexing.",
