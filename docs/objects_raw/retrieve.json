    "description": "The `retrieve` object in Pure Data fetches data from named receive objects (`r`, `else/receiver`) or GUI elements that have built-in receive names. It effectively acts as a \"send\" mechanism for these receive names, allowing data to be recalled from various parts of a patch. This functionality is particularly useful for implementing preset systems or recalling specific values.",
