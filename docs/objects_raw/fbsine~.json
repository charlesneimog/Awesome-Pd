    "description": "`fbsine~` is a sinusoidal audio oscillator that features phase modulation feedback. It supports negative frequencies, phase synchronization, and multichannel operation, allowing for complex sound generation. The object includes a built-in mean average filter in its feedback loop, which can be toggled, to smooth out high frequencies and control chaotic behavior.",
