    "description": "The `peak~` object analyzes an incoming audio signal to report its peak amplitude. Similar to `env~`, it calculates the peak value within a specified window size and outputs it as a float, either in linear scale or dBFS. It is useful for dynamic analysis and control based on signal loudness.",
