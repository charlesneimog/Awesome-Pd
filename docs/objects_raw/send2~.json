    "description": "The `send2~` object transmits audio signals to a corresponding `r~` object, similar to `send~`. Its primary advantage is automatically adapting its internal structure to the number of input channels, making it ideal for dynamic multichannel audio routing. It requires a symbol as an argument, which serves as the destination name for the signals.",
