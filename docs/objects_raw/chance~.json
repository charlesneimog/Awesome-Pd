    "description": "The `chance~` object acts as a probabilistic router for impulses, directing an incoming bang to one of its outlets based on user-defined probability weights. These probabilities can be set as percentages or a histogram, and the object utilizes a pseudo-random number generator, allowing for reproducible sequences via a seed value.",
