    "description": "The `dfreq~` object is a computationally efficient frequency detector that estimates the frequency of an incoming audio signal by counting zero-crossings. It updates its frequency estimation at every zero-crossing. While it is much cheaper than FFT-based methods, it is not designed to work properly with complex signals.",
