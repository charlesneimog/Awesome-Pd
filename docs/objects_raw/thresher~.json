    "description": "The `thresher~` object sustains the amplitude and frequency of audio signals, particularly in lower-energy parts, by applying damped bin-level feedback. It uses a `threshold` and `damping factor` to control the sustain behavior, where a higher factor increases sustain. It also features an `oscbank` toggle, which can significantly raise the output volume.",
