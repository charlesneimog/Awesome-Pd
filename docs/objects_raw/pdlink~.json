    "description": "The `pdlink~` object facilitates sending and receiving audio streams between different Pure Data instances, including various versions, platforms, and forks like PlugData. It operates over a network, simplifying inter-instance audio communication without requiring complex network configuration. Similar to `send~` and `receive~`, it uses a symbol address for routing audio, and can also communicate with `pd~` subprocesses.",
