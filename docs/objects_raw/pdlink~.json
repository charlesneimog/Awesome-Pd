    "description": "`pdlink~` enables sending and receiving audio streams between different Pure Data instances, including those on other platforms or forks, and `pd~` subprocesses. It functions like `send~` and `receive~` but operates over a network, simplifying inter-patch communication without requiring explicit network configuration. This object supports up to 16 audio sends to a single receiver.",
