    "description": "The `trig.delay2~` object delays an incoming impulse signal by a specified time in milliseconds. It ignores any subsequent triggers received before the delayed output is sent, effectively acting as a retriggerable delay. This object supports multichannel signals for both the trigger input and delay time.",
