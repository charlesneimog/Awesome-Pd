    "description": "The `nyquist~` object reports the Nyquist frequency, which is half of Pure Data's global audio sample rate, or its corresponding period. It outputs this value in various units (Hz, kHz, milliseconds, seconds) upon patch loading, receiving a `bang`, or when the sample rate changes. This object is essential for obtaining fundamental audio rate information within a Pure Data patch.",
