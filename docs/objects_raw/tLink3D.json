    "description": "The `tLink3D` object in Pure Data is designed for 3D physical modeling, simulating a link between two masses. It computes and outputs forces based on their interaction, providing data such as distance, elongation speed, center position, and orientation of the link. Additionally, it can visualize the 3D link within the Gem graphical environment.",
