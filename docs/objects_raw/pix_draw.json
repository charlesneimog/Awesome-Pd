    "description": "The `pix_draw` object directly draws pixels onto the screen without applying any texture mapping. It is primarily used for blasting raw pixel data, meaning 3D transformations like Z-axis rotations or translations will not affect its output. Users should note that `pix_draw` is generally much slower than `pix_texture` on systems with graphics accelerators.",
