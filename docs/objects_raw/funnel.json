    "description": "The `funnel` object collects data from multiple inlets and outputs it through a single outlet, prepending an inlet number to each message. This allows for routing messages based on their origin using objects like `route` or `cyclone/spray`. It can also be configured with an offset for inlet numbering and used to store values in data structures.",
