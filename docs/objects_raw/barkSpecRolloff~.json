    "description": "The `barkSpecRolloff~` object calculates the Bark spectrum rolloff, which is the Bark frequency below which a specified concentration of spectral energy is located. It processes audio in real-time, handling its own buffering and windowing, and allows configuration of window size, filterbank spacing, and the energy concentration threshold. This descriptor is useful for real-time timbre analysis."
