    "description": "`xselect2.mc~` is a multichannel signal selector that crossfades between adjacent input channels. It allows for dynamic selection of an input channel, controlled by a signal, and features a 'spread' parameter to adjust the crossfade width. It supports both indexed and circular selection modes, making it suitable for smooth transitions between multiple audio sources.",
