    "description": "The `specHarmonicity~` object quantifies the harmonic alignment of spectral peaks in an audio signal, outputting both harmonicity and inharmonicity values between 0 and 1. It identifies significant spectral peaks and assesses how well they align with a given fundamental frequency, which can be supplied externally (e.g., from `sigmund~`) or automatically derived from the lowest non-DC spectral peak. This object is useful for extracting timbral features for real-time sound analysis and classification."
