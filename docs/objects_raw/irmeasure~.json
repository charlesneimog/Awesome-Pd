    "description": "The `irmeasure~` object is designed for measuring Impulse Responses (IRs) of acoustic systems using various test signals like Exponential Sine Sweeps (ESS), maximum length sequences, or different types of noise. It provides extensive control over the deconvolution process, including filter modes, phase, bandlimiting, and amplitude inversion, to accurately extract the IR.",
