    "description": "The `order` object splits an incoming list into smaller, successive lists of a specified size, prepending each sub-list with an ordered index. This functionality is particularly useful for distributing data to multiple instances of an object managed by `[clone]`, ensuring each instance receives its corresponding indexed data. It gracefully handles input lists that are shorter than the specified split size.",
