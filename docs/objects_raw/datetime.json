When triggered by a `bang`, it outputs the time (hour, minute, second) from its left outlet and the date (year, month, day, weekday) from its right outlet. It can also output the number of seconds since the beginning of the month via a `seed` message, which can be used for time-based calculations or as a seed for other objects.",
