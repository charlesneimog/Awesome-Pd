    "description": "`tabreader~` is a signal object that reads values from a Pure Data array (table) using various interpolation methods, including spline, linear, and cosine. It supports multi-channel arrays and can function as a wavetable oscillator when driven by a `phasor~` in loop mode. It handles both 0-1 normalized indexing and direct table indexing.",
