    "description": "The `seq` object in Pure Data is a MIDI sequencer that can play, record, load, and save MIDI streams to and from MIDI or text files. It supports various playback controls like tempo adjustment, external clock synchronization, event delays, and time scaling, making it suitable for managing and manipulating musical sequences. It also allows direct recording of raw MIDI data and provides an editable view of the sequence.",
