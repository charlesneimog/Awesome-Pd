    "description": "The `out.mc~` object routes multichannel audio signals to specified `dac~` output channels, with a default starting channel of 1. It provides controls for muting, toggling DSP on/off without clicks, setting a ramp time for gain changes, and adjusting maximum gain. The object also features three scaling modes (quartic, dB, and linear) for its internal slider values, allowing for flexible gain control.",
