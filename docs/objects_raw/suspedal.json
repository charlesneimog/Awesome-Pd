    "description": "The `suspedal` object emulates a MIDI sustain pedal, holding `Note Off` messages when active and releasing them when deactivated. It supports two sustain modes: a default 'regular' mode and a 'tonal' mode, which sustains currently playing notes without affecting new ones, similar to a piano's sostenuto pedal. It also offers various retrigger behaviors for repeated notes.",
