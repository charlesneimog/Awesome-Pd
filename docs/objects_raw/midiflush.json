    "description": "The `midiflush` object acts as a \"panic button\" for raw MIDI data streams, preventing hanging notes. It tracks incoming MIDI Note-on messages and, upon receiving a `bang`, sends corresponding Note-off messages for any notes that haven't been switched off. It also accepts `float` for raw MIDI data and a `clear` message to reset its internal state.",
