    "description": "The `rand.hist` object generates weighted random numbers based on an internal histogram, allowing control over the probability of each output. It can produce sequences with or without repetition, and bangs its right outlet when a sequence is exhausted. The histogram can be dynamically updated using messages like `inc`, `dec`, `set`, `eq`, `clear`, and `size`, and the random sequence can be seeded for reproducibility.",
