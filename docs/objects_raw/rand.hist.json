    "description": "The `rand.hist` object generates weighted random numbers based on a user-defined histogram, which dictates the probability of each index being output. It can operate in a standard random mode or an \"unrepeat\" mode, where it outputs a sequence without repetition until all elements have been used, signaling completion with a bang. Users can dynamically modify the histogram, set a seed for reproducibility, and control its size.",
