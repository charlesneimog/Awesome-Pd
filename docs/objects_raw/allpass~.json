    "description": "The `allpass~` object implements an all-pass filter, which passes all frequencies without altering their gain but changes their phase. It is primarily used for filtering and delay effects, taking a signal input and outputting the processed signal. Parameters include maximum delay time, current delay time in milliseconds, and a gain coefficient.",
