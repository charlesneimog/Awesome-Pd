    "description": "The `allpass~` object implements an all-pass filter, which passes all frequencies without altering their gain but changes their phase. It is primarily used for filtering and delay effects, with configurable delay time and a gain coefficient. The object supports dynamic control of delay and gain via inlets and can be initialized with arguments for maximum delay, initial delay, and gain.",
