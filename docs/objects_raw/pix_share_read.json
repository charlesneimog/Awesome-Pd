    "description": "The `pix_share_read` object reads pixel data from a shared memory region, identified by a unique ID. It works in conjunction with a `pix_share_write` object, which writes data to the same shared memory. This allows for inter-patch or inter-instance communication of image data, requiring prior knowledge of image dimensions and color space.",
