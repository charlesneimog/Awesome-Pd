    "description": "The `grain.sampler~` object is a sample-based granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from a loaded sample. It offers extensive control over grain parameters such as duration, transposition, panning, amplitude, size, position, and reversal probability. The object supports both asynchronous and synchronous grain generation modes, with an option for autotuning grains to a specified scale.",
