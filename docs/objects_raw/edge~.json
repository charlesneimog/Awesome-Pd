    "description": "The `edge~` object detects transitions in an audio signal. It outputs a bang from its left outlet when the signal crosses from zero to non-zero, and a bang from its right outlet when the signal crosses from non-zero to zero. This is useful for triggering events based on the presence or absence of an audio signal.",
