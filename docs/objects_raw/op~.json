    "description": "The `op~` object performs various signal-rate operations, including comparative (e.g., `==`, `>`), logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`), bitwise (`&`, `|`, `~`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`), and modulus (`%`) calculations. It takes the desired operator as its first argument and processes incoming signals efficiently. This object also supports multichannel signals, handling channel mismatches by wrapping the input with fewer channels.",
