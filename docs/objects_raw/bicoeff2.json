    "description": "The `bicoeff2` object generates coefficients for Pure Data's vanilla `biquad~` object, which implements various audio filters. It takes parameters such as frequency, Q/slope, gain, and filter type (e.g., lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch, allpass, lowshelf, highshelf) to calculate the necessary filter coefficients. This object simplifies the setup of biquad filters by providing a convenient way to control their characteristics.",
