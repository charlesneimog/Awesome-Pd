    "description": "The `gray~` object generates a unique type of noise based on \"gray code\" (reflected binary code), which results from flipping random bits using a pseudo-random number generator. This noise emphasizes lower frequencies and has a high RMS level relative to its peak-to-peak level. It supports multichannel output and can be seeded for reproducible sequences.",
