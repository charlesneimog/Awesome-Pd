    "description": "The magSpec~ object calculates the magnitude spectrum of an incoming audio signal over a specified window. Upon receiving a bang, it outputs the spectrum as a list of normalized values, handling internal buffering and various windowing functions. Its output is suitable for real-time audio feature extraction and analysis."
