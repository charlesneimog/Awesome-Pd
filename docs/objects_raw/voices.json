    "description": "The `voices` object manages voice allocation for polyphonic synthesizers, similar to `poly` but with enhanced features. It outputs a list containing the voice index, pitch, and velocity, and supports various retriggering modes and a configurable release time. This object is particularly useful when combined with `clone` to build complex polyphonic instruments.",
