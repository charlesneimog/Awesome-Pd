    "description": "The `voices` object manages voice allocation for polyphonic synthesizers, offering advanced features beyond `poly`. It outputs voice index, pitch, and velocity, handling voice stealing, retrigger modes, and release times. This object is particularly useful with `clone` for constructing complex polyphonic instruments.",
