    "description": "The `loop` object in Pure Data functions as a versatile loop counter, capable of iterating through a range of numbers or generating a specified number of bangs. It can be configured with start, end, and step values, and supports pausing and resuming its iteration. This object is particularly useful for tasks like sweeping through arrays or creating controlled, rapid sequences of events.",
