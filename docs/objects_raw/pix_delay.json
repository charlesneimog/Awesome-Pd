    "description": "The `pix_delay` object creates a frame-based delay line for images, allowing a series of images to be delayed. It takes a maximum number of frames as an argument and can have its current delay adjusted via an inlet. This object is useful for creating visual feedback or temporal effects with image streams in GEM.",
