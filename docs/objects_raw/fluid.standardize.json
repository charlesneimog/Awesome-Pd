    "description": "The `fluid.standardize` object rescales a `FluidDataSet` by transforming its data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each dimension. This process, often applied to feature data like pitch and confidence, makes different data dimensions more comparable for further analysis. It's a crucial preprocessing step for many machine learning and statistical tasks.",
