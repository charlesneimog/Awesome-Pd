    "description": "The `impulse` object is a control-rate oscillator that generates bangs at a specified frequency, similar to `impulse~` but operating at a millisecond resolution. Unlike `tempo` or `metro`, it offers immediate response to rate changes, making it ideal for precise timing and event triggering. It supports frequency and initial phase arguments, and its internal phase can be reset.",
