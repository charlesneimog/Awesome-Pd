    "description": "The `buffir~` object is a table/buffer-based Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter that convolves an input signal with samples from a specified buffer. It can work with any array in Pure Data, though it only reads the first channel of multichannel `buffer~` objects. Users can configure the buffer using the `set` message, with a maximum buffer size of 4096 samples.",
