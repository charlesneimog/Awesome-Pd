    "description": "The `slew2~` object limits the rate of change of an incoming signal, similar to `slew~` but with independent speed controls for upward and downward ramps. It generates a line towards the target value, with speed defined as amplitude change per second. This is useful for smoothing control signals or preventing abrupt changes in audio, and it supports multichannel operation.",
