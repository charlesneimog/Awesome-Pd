    "description": "The `disk` object renders a flat disk, optionally with a central hole, at the current GEM OpenGL position using the current color. Its appearance can be controlled via the `draw` message, and its outer and inner radii, as well as the number of segments, can be adjusted through its inlets. This object is primarily used for 2D graphical rendering within GEM.",
