    "description": "The `pm4~` object is a 4-operator phase modulation (FM) synthesizer. It allows for complex sound generation by enabling each of its sine wave oscillators to modulate itself and any other operator. Users can control parameters such as frequency, ratio, detune, panning, volume, and the modulation matrix for each operator, and it supports multichannel audio.",
