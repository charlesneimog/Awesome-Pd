    "description": "The `pm4~` object is a 4-operator phase modulation (PM) synthesizer, utilizing sine wave oscillators. It offers extensive control over each operator's frequency ratio, detuning, panning, and volume, alongside a comprehensive modulation matrix for inter-operator modulation. Signal inputs allow dynamic control of individual operator levels, making it suitable for complex sound design and multichannel applications.",
