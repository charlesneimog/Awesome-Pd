    "description": "The `barkSpecSlope~` object calculates the slope of the best-fit line through the data points of a Bark spectrum. It processes an audio input signal and, when triggered by a bang, outputs this slope for the current analysis window. This object is primarily used as a feature for real-time timbre identification and classification."
