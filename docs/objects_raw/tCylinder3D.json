    "description": "The `tCylinder3D` object defines a 3D cylindrical volume and tests if a given 3D point (referred to as a \"mass\") is located within its boundaries. It outputs a boolean (0 or 1) indicating containment, along with the distance and speed of the mass relative to the cylinder's center. Parameters allow setting the cylinder's orientation, center, and its inner/outer radii and height limits.",
