    "description": "The `zbiplot` object visualizes biquad filter coefficients by plotting their poles and zeros in the complex plane. It takes a list of coefficients, typically from a `biquad~` object, and displays the corresponding pole and zero coordinates. This helps in understanding the frequency response characteristics of the filter.",
