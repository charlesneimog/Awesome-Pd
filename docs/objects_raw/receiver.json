    "description": "The `receiver` object in Pure Data functions similarly to the vanilla `receive` object, allowing it to receive messages sent to a specified name. A key feature is its ability to listen for messages sent to up to two different names simultaneously, which can be dynamically set via an inlet. It also supports dollar symbol expansion for abstraction management, similar to `dollsym`.",
