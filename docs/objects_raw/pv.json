    "description": "The `pv` object functions as a private variable, storing and retrieving any message type by name within a patch and its subpatches. Unlike `value`, it can handle diverse message formats, but it does not communicate with `send` or `value` objects, even if they share the same name. The help patch notes that `pv` is largely redundant and `send` is often a better alternative.",
