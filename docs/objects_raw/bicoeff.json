    "description": "The `bicoeff` object is a graphical user interface (GUI) that generates 5 biquad filter coefficients for vanilla's `biquad~` object. Users can interactively set filter parameters like frequency, bandwidth, and gain by clicking and dragging on the GUI, supporting various filter types such as `eq`, `lowpass`, and `highshelf`. It outputs a list of coefficients that can be directly fed into a `biquad~` object to create dynamic filters.",
