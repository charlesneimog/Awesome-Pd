    "description": "`randpulse2~` is a random pulse train oscillator that generates signals at random intervals, with the average frequency controlled by a \"density\" parameter. It supports multichannel operation and can output random gate values (between -1 and 1) instead of just 1, if configured. The object's random sequence can be controlled by a seed.",
