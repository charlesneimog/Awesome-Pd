    "description": "The `iPlane3D` object simulates the physical interaction between a 3D plane and a specified mass, such as a circle. It calculates forces and displacements based on parameters like the plane's position, orientation, normal force, rigidity, and damping. This object is designed for simulating physical interactions in a 3D space.",
