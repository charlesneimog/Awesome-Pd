    "description": "The `xmod2~` object is a signal generator that performs frequency modulation (FM) using two internal oscillators. It is a variant of `xmod~` designed to produce chaotic and interesting sounds through its specific sine waveform and FM capabilities. Users can control the frequencies and modulation indices of both oscillators via inlets or creation arguments.",
