    "description": "The `xgate2~` object routes a single input signal to multiple output channels with crossfading between adjacent channels. It uses a sine/cosine function for equal power crossfading, controlled by a 'spread' parameter that determines how widely the signal is distributed across channels. The output channel can be selected by a float or signal, and an indexed mode is available for direct channel number selection.",
