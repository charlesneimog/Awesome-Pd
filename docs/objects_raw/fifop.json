    "description": "The `fifop` object implements a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue system that manages multiple internal queues, each capable of being assigned a floating-point priority. It stores incoming lists and outputs them in order of priority, then FIFO order, upon receiving a `bang` message. This object is primarily used for managing and prioritizing sequences of data.",
