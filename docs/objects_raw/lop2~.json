    "description": "`lop2~` is a 1st order lowpass filter (1-pole, 1-zero) designed for audio signals. It takes an audio signal and a cutoff frequency as input, outputting the filtered signal. Unlike the vanilla `lop~` object, `lop2~` has a fixed zero at -1 on the z-plane, ensuring the Nyquist frequency is always filtered out.",
