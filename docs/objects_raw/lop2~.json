    "description": "`lop2~` is a 1st order lowpass filter designed for audio signals. Unlike standard lowpass filters, it includes a fixed zero at -1 on the z-plane, ensuring that the Nyquist frequency is always filtered out. It takes an audio signal and a cutoff frequency (float or signal) as inputs, outputting the filtered signal.",
