    "description": "The `scope3d~` object is an experimental 3D oscilloscope display for Pure Data. It visualizes audio signals in three dimensions (X, Y, Z axes) and offers various parameters for controlling its appearance, such as dimensions, zoom, perspective, line width, and refresh rate. Users can interact with the display via mouse dragging for rotation, and it supports multichannel signals where each channel corresponds to a dimension.",
