    "description": "The `index~` object reads values from an array without interpolation, similar to `tabread~` but with rounded index values. It supports multi-channel arrays (up to 64 channels), which are accessed via a `channel_number-arrayname` convention. Due to its non-interpolating nature, it is primarily suited for specific tasks like reading samples at their original speed, rather than general sample playback.",
