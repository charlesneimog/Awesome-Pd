    "description": "The `delay~` object delays an audio signal by a specified number of samples. The delay time can be set by a float (for non-interpolated delays) or a signal (for interpolated, dynamic delays, which adds a 1-sample latency). It also supports messages to clear its buffer, set a maximum delay size, and smoothly ramp to new delay times, making it fundamental for creating effects like vibrato and flanger.",
