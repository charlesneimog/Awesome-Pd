    "description": "The `drive~` object simulates analog \"soft clipping\" distortion by applying various non-linear transfer functions to an audio signal. It offers different modes, including a tanh function and threshold-based clipping, controlled by a drive factor. This object is primarily used to add harmonic saturation and warmth to audio.",
