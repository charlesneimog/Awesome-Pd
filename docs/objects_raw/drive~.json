    "description": "The `drive~` object in Pure Data simulates analog soft-clipping distortion by applying various non-linear transfer functions. It processes an audio signal input, using a 'drive factor' to control the intensity and character of the distortion. Different modes offer distinct distortion curves, effectively shaping the signal's dynamics and adding harmonic content.",
