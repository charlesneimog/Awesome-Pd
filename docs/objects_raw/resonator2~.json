    "description": "The `resonator2~` object is a resonant complex one-pole filter, designed to be excited by impulses. It produces two oscillating outputs, one with a cosine and one with a sine initial phase, making it suitable for creating resonant effects and simplified physical models like a 'Spring Model'.",
