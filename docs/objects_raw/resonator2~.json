    "description": "`resonator2~` is a resonant filter, similar to `vcf~` and `resonator~`, designed to be excited by impulses. It takes a frequency and a decay time to produce an oscillating output, with separate outlets for cosine and sine initial phases. This object can simulate a simplified spring model and is suitable for creating resonant textures or pitched feedback.",
