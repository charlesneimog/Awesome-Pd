    "description": "The `greaterthaneq~` (or `>=~`) object performs a \"greater than or equal to\" comparison for audio signals. It outputs a signal of 1 when its left inlet's signal is greater than or equal to the right inlet's signal or argument, and 0 otherwise. This object is useful for creating signal-based conditional logic.",
