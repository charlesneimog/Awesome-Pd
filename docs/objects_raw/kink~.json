    "description": "The `kink~` object distorts a `phasor~` signal by applying a non-linear bend or \"kink\" to its phase. It takes a phase input and a slope, modifying the output based on whether the phase times the slope is above or below a 0.5 threshold. This results in a distorted phasor output, useful for various forms of phase modulation and waveshaping.",
