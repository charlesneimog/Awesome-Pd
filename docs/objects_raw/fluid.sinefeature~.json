    "description": "The `fluid.sinefeature~` object calculates spectral difference features, primarily used by `fluid.onsetslice~`. It performs peak detection on audio signals, reporting peak frequencies and magnitudes based on configurable FFT settings, windowing, and detection thresholds. This object is crucial for analyzing the sinusoidal components of a sound.",
