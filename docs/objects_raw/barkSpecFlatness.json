    "description": "The `barkSpecFlatness` object calculates the spectral flatness of an audio signal within Bark-scaled frequency bands. It analyzes a specified window of a sample array, providing a measure of how noise-like or tone-like the sound is in perceptually relevant frequency regions. It supports various analysis parameters like windowing functions and can process pre-computed spectral data."
