    "description": "The `cyclone` library for Pure Data provides a comprehensive set of mathematical and comparative operators, many of which are direct aliases for common Max/MSP objects. It includes essential functions like equality (`==~`), inequality (`!=~`), less than (`<~`), greater than (`>~`), modulo (`%~`), and various arithmetic operations. This library is designed to offer familiar functionality and ease the transition for users accustomed to Max/MSP's object naming conventions.",
