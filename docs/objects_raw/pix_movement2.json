    "description": "The `pix_movement2` object is a time-based IIR filter designed for motion detection in video streams. It analyzes the current frame against two previous frames and a user-defined background image, outputting a greyscale image highlighting detected movement. It includes adjustable threshold parameters (`lo_threshold`, `initial_threshold`) to filter out image noise and dynamically adapt to changing conditions.",
