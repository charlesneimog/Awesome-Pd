    "description": "The `energyEntropy~` object measures abrupt changes in the energy of an audio signal. It processes audio in mid-term windows, which are composed of smaller sub-windows, and outputs a lower entropy value when there are more abrupt energy changes. This feature is useful for identifying sudden energy shifts in either direction, making it suitable for real-time timbre identification.",
