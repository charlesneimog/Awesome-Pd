    "description": "`reson~` is a bandpass resonant filter designed for audio signals. It allows dynamic control over gain, center frequency, and resonance (Q) through both float and signal inputs. As a recursive filter, it provides a `clear` message to reset its internal state, which can be useful if the filter becomes unstable.",
