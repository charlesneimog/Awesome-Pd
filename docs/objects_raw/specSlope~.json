    "description": "The `specSlope~` object calculates the spectral slope of an incoming audio signal, representing the slope of the best-fit line through its magnitude spectrum. It handles internal audio buffering and windowing, allowing configuration of window size and function. This object is primarily used as a feature extractor for timbre analysis and classification within the `timbreIDLib`.",
