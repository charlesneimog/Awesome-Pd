    "description": "`filterdelay~` is a high-level audio delay unit that integrates a resonant lowpass filter, a soft clipper, and a DC filter within its feedback loop. It allows for dynamic control over delay time, feedback amount, filter cutoff, and resonance, offering a versatile tool for creating complex, modulated delay effects. The object also features a `freeze` parameter to stop input recording while allowing continued modulation of delay and filter parameters.",
