    "description": "The `mindwarp~` object performs spectral envelope warping, primarily utilizing frequency shaping. It is designed to manipulate the spectral characteristics of a signal, often in conjunction with pitch-scaling or phase vocoder processes (like `pvoc~`). Users can control the warping effect using parameters such as \"warp factor\" and \"shape width\".",
