    "description": "The `pack` object combines multiple incoming atoms (numbers, symbols, or pointers) from its inlets into a single list message. Part of the zexy library, this version offers enhanced initialization capabilities compared to Pure Data's built-in `pack`, particularly for symbols. It is primarily used for structuring diverse data types into a coherent message for subsequent processing.",
