    "description": "The `allpass.2nd~` object is a 2nd order allpass filter that shifts the phase of an audio signal from 0 to 360 degrees across the frequency spectrum. Its behavior is controlled by a center frequency and a resonance (Q or bandwidth) parameter. When mixed with the original signal, it can create comb filtering effects by phase opposition.",
