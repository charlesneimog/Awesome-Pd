    "description": "The `oscbank~` object generates complex audio signals by combining multiple `sine~` oscillators, allowing users to define a list of partials, amplitudes, and phases for each. It takes a frequency multiplier as its main input, serving as the fundamental frequency for the entire bank. Additionally, it supports multichannel output, where each individual oscillator is routed to a separate channel.",
