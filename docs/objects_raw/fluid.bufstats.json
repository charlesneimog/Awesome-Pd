    "description": "The `fluid.bufstats` object calculates various statistical descriptors (e.g., mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, pitch) from segments within an audio buffer. It can analyze these statistics, apply weightings, and filter outliers, enabling the sorting or further processing of audio segments based on their statistical properties. This is useful for detailed audio analysis and feature extraction.",
