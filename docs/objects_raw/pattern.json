    "description": "The `pattern` object is a rhythmic pattern sequencer that outputs note durations based on a defined sequence. Durations can be specified as floats or fractions (where 1 is a whole note), with negative values indicating rests, and a `|` symbol separating bars. It supports setting tempo, starting/stopping, and dynamically updating sequences, making it suitable for complex rhythmic generation.",
