    "description": "The `fluid.nmffilter~` object decomposes and resynthesizes an audio signal by filtering it against spectral templates, or \"bases,\" typically generated by `fluid.bufnmf~`. It allows for selective resynthesis of components, including the ability to delay components with a low spectral centroid, effectively acting as a spectral filter based on learned characteristics.",
