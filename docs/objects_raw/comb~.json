    "description": "The `comb~` object implements a comb filter, which can be used for both filtering and delay effects on audio signals. It takes an input signal and applies a delay with feedforward and feedback gain coefficients, defined by the equation `y[n] = a * x[n] + b * x[n-D] + c * y[n-D]`. Parameters for delay time (`D`), input gain (`a`), feedforward gain (`b`), and feedback gain (`c`) can be controlled via inlets or arguments.",
