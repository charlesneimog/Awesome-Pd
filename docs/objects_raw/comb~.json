    "description": "The `comb~` object implements a comb filter, an audio effect that combines a signal with a delayed version of itself to create a series of regularly spaced notches or peaks in the frequency response. It is primarily used for filtering and creating delay-based effects, with adjustable parameters for delay time (`D`), input gain (`a`), feedforward gain (`b`), and feedback gain (`c`).",
