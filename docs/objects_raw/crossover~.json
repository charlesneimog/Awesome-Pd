    "description": "The `crossover~` object functions as a 3rd order Butterworth crossover filter, designed to split an incoming audio signal into distinct low-pass and high-pass components. It provides two outlets for these filtered signals and allows for dynamic control of the cutoff frequency via a float or signal input. The filter's internal memory can be reset using a 'clear' message.",
