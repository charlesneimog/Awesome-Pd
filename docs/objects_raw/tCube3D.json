    "description": "The `tCube3D` object determines if a given 3D point (referred to as a \"mass\") is located within a user-defined 3D bounding box. It takes the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the mass as input and outputs `1` if the mass is inside the specified cube, and `0` if it is outside. This object is primarily used for spatial collision detection or position testing in 3D environments.",
