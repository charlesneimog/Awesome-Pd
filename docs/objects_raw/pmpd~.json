    "description": "The `pmpd~` object is a 1D particle-based physical modeling external for audio synthesis in Pure Data. It allows users to construct physical systems by creating masses and connecting them with links, then apply forces or control positions at audio rate. The object outputs position or velocity data from the simulated masses, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive sounds.",
