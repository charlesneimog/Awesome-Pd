    "description": "The `ms2samps` object is a simple utility that converts a time value in milliseconds to the equivalent number of audio samples. It uses the formula `samps = ms * samplerate/1000` for this conversion. This object is useful for precisely timing events or durations within Pure Data patches based on the current audio sample rate.",
