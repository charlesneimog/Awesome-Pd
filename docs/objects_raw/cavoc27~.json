    "description": "The `cavoc27~` object generates audio spectra using a 27-rule cellular automaton. It can interpolate between spectra, freeze the current spectrum, and transpose its output, especially when using its internal oscillator bank for resynthesis. Additionally, `cavoc27~` can capture external audio spectra to use as a tuning source, allowing for dynamic interaction with other audio signals.",
