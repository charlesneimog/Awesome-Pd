    "description": "The `bfcc~` object computes Bark-frequency cepstral coefficients (BFCCs) from an audio input, emphasizing lower spectral content and using a Discrete Cosine Transform. It outputs a list of BFCCs upon receiving a bang, handling internal audio buffering and windowing. This object is useful for extracting perceptually relevant features from audio for tasks like timbre identification."
