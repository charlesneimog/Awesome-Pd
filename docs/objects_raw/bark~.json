    "description": "The `bark~` object is a real-time onset detector for Pure Data, which analyzes spectral growth using the perceptually-based Bark frequency scale. It outputs a bang upon detecting an onset, along with the total energy growth and a list of growth values per Bark band. This object is ideal for applications requiring robust transient detection in audio signals."
