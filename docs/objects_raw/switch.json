    "description": "The `switch` object in Pure Data acts as a message router, allowing only one of its 'n' inlets to pass data through to its single outlet at a time. The leftmost inlet controls which of the other inlets is \"switched on\" by receiving a float value (0 closes all, positive integers select the corresponding inlet). It can handle any type of message.",
