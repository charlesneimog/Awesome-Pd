    "description": "`ikeda~` is a chaotic signal generator based on the Ikeda map, producing two outputs: `y1[n]` and `y2[n]`. It allows control over its rate, a 'u' parameter, and initial `y1[n-1]` and `y2[n-1]` values. This object generates a DC offset and is inherently unstable, often requiring external filtering and a 'clear' message to reset its state.",
