    "description": "The `phon2sone` object converts a loudness level expressed in phons to a perceived loudness value in sones. It accounts for the logarithmic relationship between decibels and loudness, where 1 sone is equivalent to 40 phons. This object is useful for psychoacoustic calculations related to sound perception.",
