    "description": "The `pix_buf` object, also known as `pix_separator`, buffers image data (pixes) to store the results of time-consuming processing operations. It is most effective when buffering static images, as continuous upstream modifications will lead to inefficient pixel copying. This object can also separate `gemlist` streams processing the same image data, acting as a flow control utility within the GEM environment.",
