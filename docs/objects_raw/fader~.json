    "description": "The `fader~` object is a signal waveshaper designed for crossfading and amplitude modulation. It takes a signal input between 0 and 1 and applies one of seven predefined mathematical curves, such as `quartic`, `sin`, `sqrt`, `hann`, or linear, to shape its amplitude. This object is particularly useful for creating smooth transitions between audio signals and supports multichannel processing.",
