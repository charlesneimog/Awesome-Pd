    "description": "The `midiformat` object converts various discrete MIDI inputs, such as note, control change, and pitch bend messages, into a single raw MIDI message stream. It serves as the counterpart to `midiparse`, enabling the construction of complete MIDI messages from individual components. This object is essential for preparing structured MIDI data for output or further processing.",
