    "description": "The `wt2d~` object is an interpolating wavetable oscillator that can scan through two dimensions (X and Y) of a sliced wavetable. It supports phase modulation and synchronization, allowing for techniques like hard and soft sync. It also features multichannel operation and various interpolation methods, and can accept frequency input in Hz or MIDI pitch.",
