    "description": "The `wt2d~` object is a 2-dimensional wavetable oscillator that reads from a Pure Data array. It can scan and crossfade through both horizontal and vertical dimensions of a sliced wavetable, enabling complex timbre manipulation. It supports phase modulation, synchronization, multichannel audio, and various interpolation methods.",
