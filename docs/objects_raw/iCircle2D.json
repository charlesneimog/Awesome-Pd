    "description": "The `iCircle2D` object simulates circular interactions in 2D space, applying various forces and displacements to an interacting mass. It defines a circular region with adjustable center and radii, influencing the mass with parameters like constant normal/tangential forces, rigidity, damping, and gravitational effects. This object is designed for physical modeling and interaction simulations.",
