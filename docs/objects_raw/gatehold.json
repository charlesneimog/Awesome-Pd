    "description": "The `gatehold` object extends the duration of a gate signal by a specified amount of time (in milliseconds) after the gate has closed. If a new gate signal is received before the hold time expires, the object re-triggers, effectively restarting the hold period. This allows for precise control over the timing and sustain of gate-dependent processes, such as envelopes.",
