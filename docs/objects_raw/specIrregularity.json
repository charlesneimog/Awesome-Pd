    "description": "The `specIrregularity` object calculates the spectral irregularity of an audio signal, providing a numerical descriptor of its timbral characteristics. It supports both Jensen and Krimphoff algorithms, analyzing full audio arrays or specific windows with various windowing functions. Designed for efficiency, it can integrate into analysis chains by accepting pre-computed FFT or magnitude spectrum data."
