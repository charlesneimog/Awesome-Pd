    "description": "The `mux` object functions as a multiplexer, directing the signal from one of its multiple input inlets to its single outlet. The specific input inlet to be routed is determined by a float value received in the rightmost inlet, with inlets numbered starting from 0. The total number of input inlets is configured by the arguments provided during the object's creation.",
