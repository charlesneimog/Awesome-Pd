    "description": "The `greaterthan~` (or `>~`) object performs a sample-by-sample comparison between two signal inputs. It outputs a signal of 1 if the left inlet's signal is strictly greater than the right inlet's signal or argument, otherwise it outputs 0. This object is fundamental for implementing conditional logic within signal processing.",
