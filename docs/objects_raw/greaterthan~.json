    "description": "The `greaterthan~` (or `>~`) object in Pure Data performs a signal comparison. It outputs a signal of 1 when its left input signal is strictly greater than its right input signal or argument, and a signal of 0 otherwise. This allows for real-time, sample-accurate conditional logic based on signal values.",
