    "description": "The `kalman` object implements a simple, linear, one-dimensional Kalman filter. It is used to filter noisy incoming data by estimating the mean and noise covariance, providing a more accurate and predictive output. The object can also analyze data to set initial conditions, improving efficiency by reducing the number of necessary iterations.",
