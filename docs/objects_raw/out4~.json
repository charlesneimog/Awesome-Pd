    "description": "`out4~` is a quadraphonic audio output abstraction for Pure Data, providing click-free control over DSP on/off, mute, and gain. It features three scaling modes (quartic, dB, linear) for its internal slider and allows setting a ramp time for smooth transitions. It routes incoming signals to `dac~` channels 1-4, requiring at least four audio output channels configured.",
