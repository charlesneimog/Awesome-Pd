    "description": "The barkSpecKurtosis object calculates the kurtosis of the Bark spectrum, serving as an audio descriptor within the timbreIDLib. It analyzes audio signals or specified portions of sample arrays, providing a statistical measure of the \"peakedness\" of the Bark spectrum. The object supports various windowing functions and can efficiently process pre-computed spectral data."
