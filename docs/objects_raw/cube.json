    "description": "The `cube` object renders a 3D cube within the GEM (Graphics Environment for Multimedia) context. Its size can be dynamically adjusted via the second inlet, and it can be drawn as an outline, filled, or as points using messages to its first inlet. This object is fundamental for creating basic 3D geometric shapes in Pure Data.",
