    "description": "The `atodb~` object converts a linear amplitude signal to its equivalent in decibels full scale (dBFS). This is useful for representing audio levels logarithmically, where 0 dBFS typically signifies the maximum amplitude without clipping. It performs the calculation `dbFS = log10(amp) * 20`, with a minimum output of -999.",
