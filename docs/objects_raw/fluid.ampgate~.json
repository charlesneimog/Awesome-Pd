    "description": "`fluid.ampgate~` is a real-time absolute amplitude threshold gate detector for audio signals. It identifies onsets and offsets by comparing the signal's amplitude against configurable thresholds, allowing for lookahead/lookback and minimum gate durations. This object is useful for segmenting audio or controlling signal flow based on amplitude events.",
