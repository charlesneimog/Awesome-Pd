    "description": "`tanh~` calculates the hyperbolic tangent of an input signal. It is primarily used for waveshaping, simulating analog distortion through soft clipping by gently limiting signal values between -1 and 1. This produces a distortion characteristic similar to overdriven analog circuitry.",
