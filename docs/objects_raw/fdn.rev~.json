    "description": "`fdn.rev~` is a feedback delay network (FDN) reverberator designed to simulate late reflections, commonly known as the reverb tail. Its primary parameters are the reverberation decay time (t60) and high-frequency damping, which controls how quickly higher frequencies decay. The object's internal delay lines can be configured using a list of values to set the matrix size and individual delay times, which can be spaced linearly or exponentially.",
