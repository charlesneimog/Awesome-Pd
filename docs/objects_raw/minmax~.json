    "description": "The `minmax~` object continuously tracks the minimum and maximum amplitude values of an incoming audio signal. It outputs these extreme values as both signals and discrete floats, which can be reset at any time. This makes it useful for dynamic signal analysis, such as determining the range for normalization.",
