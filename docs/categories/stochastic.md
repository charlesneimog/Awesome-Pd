- :material-tune: [__lfnoise~__](../objects/lfnoise~.md) `lfnoise~` is a low frequency (band limited) noise with or without interpolation.

- :material-tune: [__white~__](../objects/white~.md) `white~` is a white noise generator from a pseudo random number generator algorithm.

- :material-tune: [__gray~__](../objects/gray~.md) `gray~` generates noise based on "gray code" or reflected binary code (RBC), which results from flipping random bits (sot is is based on a pseudo random number generator algorithm.).

- :material-tune: [__dust~__](../objects/dust~.md) The `dust~` object in Pure Data is a pseudo-random impulse generator that outputs positive random impulses (up to 1) according to a configurable density (rate) parameter.

- :material-tune: [__urn__](../objects/urn.md) `urn` generates random numbers in a range defined by the 'n' size (from 0 to n-1) without repeating them.

- :material-tune: [__oscnoise~__](../objects/oscnoise~.md) `oscnoise~` is an oscillator that accepts negative frequencies, has inlets for phase sync and phase modulation.

- :material-tune: [__rand.hist__](../objects/rand.hist.md) `rand.hist` generates weighted randomnumbers based on a histogram (which specifies how many times an index is output).

- :material-tune: [__brown~__](../objects/brown~.md) `brown~` is a brown noise generator (aka brownian noise or red noise), whose spectral energy drops 6dB per octave (sounding less hissy than white noise).

- :material-tune: [__drunkard~__](../objects/drunkard~.md) `drunkard~` generates random nvalues within a given step range from the last output.

- :material-tune: [__rand.f__](../objects/rand.f.md) `rand.f` generates random float values for a given range when triggered with a bang.

- :material-tune: [__brown__](../objects/brown.md) `brown` is a control brownian motion generator.

- :material-tune: [__rampnoise~__](../objects/rampnoise~.md) `rampnoise~` is a low frequency (band limited) noise generator with interpolation, therefore it ramps from one random value to another, resulting in random ramps.

- :material-tune: [__gendyn~__](../objects/gendyn~.md) `gendyn~` implements "Dynamic Strochastic Synthesis" based on Xenakis' GenDyn algorithm.

- :material-tune: [__randpulse~__](../objects/randpulse~.md) `randpulse~` is a random pulse train oscillator (which alternates between a random value and 0, or on/off).

- :material-tune: [__stepnoise~__](../objects/stepnoise~.md) `stepnoise~` is a low frequency (band limited) noise generator without interpolation, therefore it holds at a random value, resulting in random steps.

- :material-tune: [__rand.u__](../objects/rand.u.md) `rand.u` generates an unrepeated random values (from 0 to size-1).

- :material-tune: [__perlin~__](../objects/perlin~.md) `perlin~` is an abastraction that implements 1-dimensional Perlin Noise (a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin).

- :material-tune: [__rand.dist__](../objects/rand.dist.md) `rand.dist` is an abstraction based on `array quantile` and generates random numbers that follow a probability density function (given by an array).

- :material-tune: [__rand.i~__](../objects/rand.i~.md) `rand.i~` generates random integer values for a given range when triggered.

- :material-tune: [__velvet~__](../objects/velvet~.md) `velvet~` is a velvet noise generator, which randomly chooses either positive (1) or negative (-1) impulses at random positions in a given period set in Hz.

- :material-tune: [__pink~__](../objects/pink~.md) `pink~` is a pink noise generator, which sounds less hissy than white noise (but not as less as brown~).

- :material-tune: [__rand.i__](../objects/rand.i.md) `rand.i` generates random integer values for a given range when triggered with as bang.Use the seed message if you want a reproducible output.

- :material-tune: [__randpulse2~__](../objects/randpulse2~.md) `randpulse2~` is a random pulse train oscillator.
