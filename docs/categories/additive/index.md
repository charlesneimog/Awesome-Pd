- :material-tune: [__cavoc27~__](../../objects/cavoc27~.md) The `cavoc27~` object generates audio spectra using a 27-rule cellular automaton.
- :material-tune: [__oscbank~__](../../objects/oscbank~.md) The `oscbank~` object generates complex audio signals by combining multiple `sine~` oscillators, allowing users to define a list of partials, amplitudes, and phases for each.
- :material-tune: [__enrich~__](../../objects/enrich~.md) The `enrich~` object performs additive synthesis by generating an oscillator bank.
- :material-tune: [__blip~__](../../objects/blip~.md) `blip~` is a band-limited oscillator that generates waveforms by summing cosines using Discrete-Summation Formulae (DSF).
- :material-tune: [__pileup~__](../../objects/pileup~.md) The `pileup~` object performs spectral persistence by maintaining amplitude and phase information in frequency bins.
- :material-tune: [__cavoc~__](../../objects/cavoc~.md) The `cavoc~` object generates audio spectra using an 8-rule cellular automaton.
