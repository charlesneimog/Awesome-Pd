- :material-tune: [__pdlink__](../objects/pdlink.md) `pdlink` allows you to communicate to/from different Pd instances over local network, as different versions and even forks of Pure Data (such as plugdata).

- :material-tune: [__pdlink~__](../objects/pdlink~.md) `pdlink~` allows you to send/receive audio streans to/from different Pd instances, as different versions, platforms and even forks of Pure Data (such as PlugData).

- :material-tune: [__osc.format__](../objects/osc.format.md) `osc.format` is similar to Vanilla's `oscformat`.

- :material-tune: [__osc.receive__](../objects/osc.receive.md) `osc.receive` receives OSC messages from network connections and is an abstraction based on `osc.parse` and `netreceive`.

- :material-tune: [__play.file~__](../objects/play.file~.md) `play.file~` reads/plays files from your computer similarly to Vanilla's `readsf~`, but it supports more file formats (officialy AAC, AIF, CAF, FLAC, MP3, OGG, OPUS & WAV).

- :material-tune: [__osc.send__](../objects/osc.send.md) `osc.send` sends OSC messages over the network and is an abstraction based on `osc.format` and `netsend`.

- :material-tune: [__osc.route__](../objects/osc.route.md) `osc.route` routes OSC messages received from `osc.receive`.

- :material-tune: [__osc.parse__](../objects/osc.parse.md) `osc.parse` is similar to Vanilla's `oscparse` but the output is not a list and more closely related on how OSC messages are generally dealt with.
