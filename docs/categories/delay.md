- :material-tune: [__fdn.rev~__](../objects/fdn.rev~.md) `fdn.rev~` is a feedback delay network reverberator which can be used for late reflections (a.k.a reverb tail).

- :material-tune: [__mono.rev~__](../objects/mono.rev~.md) `mono.rev~` is a reverb abstraction with mono input but stereo output.

- :material-tune: [__pipe2__](../objects/pipe2.md) `pipe2` is similar to vanilla's pipe.

- :material-tune: [__echo.rev~__](../objects/echo.rev~.md) `echo.rev~` is an echo/reverb abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__del~__](../objects/del~.md) `del~` sets and writes to a delay line if created as `del~ in` (default) and reads from it (with interpolation) if created as `del~ out`.

- :material-tune: [__filterdelay~__](../objects/filterdelay~.md) `filterdelay~` is a high level delay unit that goes thgouh a resonant lowpass filter, a soft clipper and a DC filter.

- :material-tune: [__revdelay~__](../objects/revdelay~.md) `revdelay~` is a reverse delay effect.

- :material-tune: [__repeat~__](../objects/repeat~.md) `repeat~` takes an input signal os any channel size and repeats it 'n' times.
