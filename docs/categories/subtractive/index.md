- :material-tune: [__bl.vsaw~__](../../objects/bl.vsaw~.md) `bl.vsaw~` is a bandlimited variable sawtooth waveform oscillator that can also generate triangular waveforms.
- :material-tune: [__bl.square~__](../../objects/bl.square~.md) `bl.square~` is a bandlimited square wave oscillator designed for synthesis, providing anti-aliased output.
- :material-tune: [__vcf.m~__](../../objects/vcf.m~.md) `vcf.m~` is a single-channel lowpass filter module.
- :material-tune: [__saw2~__](../../objects/saw2~.md) The `saw2~` object is a versatile sawtooth wave oscillator that supports negative frequencies and multichannel operation.
- :material-tune: [__bl.osc~__](../../objects/bl.osc~.md) `bl.osc~` is a bandlimited oscillator that generates various waveforms like saw, triangle, square, and impulse.
