<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tune: [__grain.sampler~__](../../objects/grain.sampler~.md) The `grain.sampler~` object is a sample-based granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from a loaded sample.
- :material-tune: [__grain.live~__](../../objects/grain.live~.md) `grain.live~` is a live input granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from an incoming signal.
- :material-tune: [__envgen~__](../../objects/envgen~.md) `envgen~` is a versatile audio envelope and line generator that creates complex amplitude curves based on lists of duration and target values.
- :material-tune: [__grain.synth~__](../../objects/grain.synth~.md) `grain.synth~` is a waveform-based granular synthesizer that generates clouds of pitched grains.
- :material-tune: [__autofade.mc~__](../../objects/autofade.mc~.md) The `autofade.mc~` object provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multichannel audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__autofade2.mc~__](../../objects/autofade2.mc~.md) The `autofade2.mc~` object provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multichannel audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__autofade2~__](../../objects/autofade2~.md) `autofade2~` is a Pure Data object that provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multiple audio inputs.
- :material-tune: [__asr~__](../../objects/asr~.md) The `asr~` object generates an attack/sustain/release envelope, acting as a simplified version of `adsr~`.
- :material-tune: [__curve~__](../../objects/curve~.md) `curve~` is a signal-rate object that generates non-linear (curved) ramp signals, functioning as an envelope generator.
- :material-tune: [__adsr~__](../../objects/adsr~.md) `adsr~` is an audio-rate Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release envelope generator.
- :material-tune: [__function__](../../objects/function.md) The `function` object is a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating and manipulating breakpoint functions.
- :material-tune: [__envelope~__](../../objects/envelope~.md) The `envelope~` object generates various single-cycle envelope waveforms (e.g., sine, Hanning, triangular, Gaussian, trapezoidal) based on a phase input.
- :material-tune: [__ramp~__](../../objects/ramp~.md) The `ramp~` object generates a linear signal that ramps between a specified minimum and maximum value.
- :material-tune: [__peak~__](../../objects/peak~.md) `peak~` is a Pure Data signal object that analyzes an incoming audio signal and outputs its peak amplitude.
- :material-tune: [__decay~__](../../objects/decay~.md) `decay~` is a one-pole filter that generates an exponential decay from input impulses.
- :material-tune: [__envrms~__](../../objects/envrms~.md) The `envrms~` object is an envelope follower designed for audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__autofade~__](../../objects/autofade~.md) The `autofade~` object provides automatic fade-in and fade-out functionality for multiple audio inputs.
- :material-tune: [__adsr.m~__](../../objects/adsr.m~.md) The `adsr.m~` object is a polyphonic ADSR envelope generator.
- :material-tune: [__line~__](../../objects/line~.md) The `cyclone/line~` object generates linear signal ramps or envelopes.
