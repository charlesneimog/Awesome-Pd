- :material-tune: [__spectrograph~__](../../objects/spectrograph~.md) The `spectrograph~` object visualizes the FFT amplitudes of an incoming audio signal, displaying frequencies from 0 Hz to Nyquist.
- :material-tune: [__mtx.ctl__](../../objects/mtx.ctl.md) `mtx.ctl` provides a graphical user interface for controlling a matrix.
- :material-tune: [__scope3d~__](../../objects/scope3d~.md) The `scope3d~` object is an experimental 3D oscilloscope display for Pure Data.
- :material-tune: [__tLink3D__](../../objects/tLink3D.md) The `tLink3D` object in Pure Data is designed for 3D physical modeling, simulating a link between two masses.
- :material-tune: [__pmpd3d__](../../objects/pmpd3d.md) The `pmpd3d` object implements 3D physical models based on a mass-spring-damper system.
- :material-tune: [__pic__](../../objects/pic.md) The `pic` object in Pure Data displays image files (`.gif`, `.ppm`, `.pgm`) within a patch.
- :material-tune: [__scope~__](../../objects/scope~.md) `scope~` is a Pure Data object that functions as an oscilloscope, visualizing audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__biplot__](../../objects/biplot.md) The `biplot` object visualizes the frequency response of biquad filters.
- :material-tune: [__canvas.pos__](../../objects/canvas.pos.md) The `canvas.pos` object reports the x/y coordinates of a subpatch's canvas relative to its parent.
- :material-tune: [__graph~__](../../objects/graph~.md) `graph~` is a simple Pure Data abstraction designed for visualizing audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__slider2d__](../../objects/slider2d.md) The `slider2d` object is a two-dimensional graphical user interface (GUI) slider for Pure Data.
