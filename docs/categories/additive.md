- :material-tune: [__pvoc.freeze~__](../objects/pvoc.freeze~.md) `pvoc.freeze~` is a freeze object based on a phase vocoder.
.

- :material-tune: [__resonbank~__](../objects/resonbank~.md) `resonbank~` is a bank of resonators made of `resonator~` objects.

- :material-tune: [__wavetable~__](../objects/wavetable~.md) `wavetable~` is an interpolating wavetable oscillator like `tabosc4~`, but has more features like more interpolation options, inlets for phase sync, phase modulation and also an inlet for scanning through slices.

- :material-tune: [__oscbank~__](../objects/oscbank~.md) `oscbank~` is a bank made of `sine~` objects.

- :material-tune: [__plaits~__](../objects/plaits~.md) `plaits~` is a Pure Data external based on the "Plaits" macro-oscillator module by Mutable Instruments.

- :material-tune: [__blip~__](../objects/blip~.md) `blip~` uses DSF (Discrete-Summation Formulae) to generate waveforms as a sum of cosines.

- :material-tune: [__resonbank2~__](../objects/resonbank2~.md) `resonbank2~` is a bank of resonators made of `resonator2~` objects.

- :material-tune: [__morph~__](../objects/morph~.md) `morph~` allows you to make a spectral crossfade between the amplitudes and phases of two inputs.

- :material-tune: [__freeze~__](../objects/freeze~.md) `freeze~` is an abstraction based on `sigmund~` (analysis & ressynthesis).

- :material-tune: [__bl.osc~__](../objects/bl.osc~.md) `bl.osc~` is a bandlimited oscillator based on `else/wavetable~`.
