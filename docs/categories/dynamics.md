- :material-tune: [__resonant~__](../objects/resonant~.md) `resonant~` is a bandpass resonator filter like `bandpass~`, but it doesn't have a maximum dB value of 0, so changing the Q increases the gain of the filter.

- :material-tune: [__autofade.mc~__](../objects/autofade.mc~.md) `autofade.mc~` is an automatic fade in/out for multichanne inputs.

- :material-tune: [__autofade2.mc~__](../objects/autofade2.mc~.md) `autofade2.mc~` is an automatic fade in/out for multichanne inputs.

- :material-tune: [__slew2~__](../objects/slew2~.md) `slew2~` is like `slew~` but has independent values for upwards & downwards ramps.

- :material-tune: [__rampsmooth~__](../objects/rampsmooth~.md) `rampsmooth~` smooths a signal across 'n' samples.

- :material-tune: [__autofade2~__](../objects/autofade2~.md) `autofade2~` is an automatic fade in/out for multi inputs.

- :material-tune: [__spread.mc~__](../objects/spread.mc~.md) `spread.mc~` spreads any number of input channels across any number of output channels with equal power panning according to a spread parameter.

- :material-tune: [__smooth2~__](../objects/smooth2~.md) `smooth2~` is just like `smooth~` but has distinct ramp times for both up and down.
.

- :material-tune: [__maxpeak~__](../objects/maxpeak~.md) `maxpeak~` returns the maximum peak amplitude so far.

- :material-tune: [__out4~__](../objects/out4~.md) `out4~` is a convenient quadraphonic input/output abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__db2lin~__](../objects/db2lin~.md) `db2lin~` converts amplitude values from deciBel Full Scale (dBFS) to linear.

- :material-tune: [__xgate2.mc~__](../objects/xgate2.mc~.md) `xgate2.mc~` routes an input signal to 'n' specified channels in a multichannel output with crossfading between adjacent channels according to a spread parameter.
.

- :material-tune: [__lag2~__](../objects/lag2~.md) `lag2~` is like `lag~` but has a different time for ramp up and ramp down.

- :material-tune: [__norm~__](../objects/norm~.md) `norm~` is a normalizer abstraction based on `mov.rms~`.

- :material-tune: [__level~__](../objects/level~.md) `level~` is a convenient abstraction for adjusting a signal's gain in dB.

- :material-tune: [__gain~__](../objects/gain~.md) `gain~` is a convenient mono gain abstraction for adjusting a signal's gain.

- :material-tune: [__compress~__](../objects/compress~.md) `compress~` is an abstraction that performs compression.

- :material-tune: [__meter~__](../objects/meter~.md) `meter~` is a convenient mono VU-meter abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__gain2~__](../objects/gain2~.md) `gain2~` is a convenient stereo gain abstraction, so you can adjust a stereo signal's gain.

- :material-tune: [__meter2~__](../objects/meter2~.md) `meter2~` is a convenient stereo VU-meter abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__noisegate~__](../objects/noisegate~.md) `noisegate~` is a noise gate abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__db2lin__](../objects/db2lin.md) `db2lin` converts amplitude values from deciBel Full Scale (dBFS) to linear.

- :material-tune: [__out.mc~__](../objects/out.mc~.md) `out.mc~` takes multichannel signals and outputs them from given `dac~` channel output (default 1).

- :material-tune: [__autofade~__](../objects/autofade~.md) `autofade~` is an automatic fade in/out for multi inputs.
