- :material-tune: [__pvoc.freeze~__](../../objects/pvoc.freeze~.md) The `pvoc.freeze~` object is a phase vocoder-based audio processor that allows for "freezing" a sound.
- :material-tune: [__pvwarpb~__](../../objects/pvwarpb~.md) `pvwarpb~` is a spectral warper that applies an internal frequency warping function to audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__pvoc~__](../../objects/pvoc~.md) The `pvoc~` object performs phase vocoding, a technique for time-stretching or pitch-shifting audio by analyzing its frequency content.
- :material-tune: [__resent~__](../../objects/resent~.md) `resent~` is a spectral sample buffer that captures an input audio signal for manipulation.
- :material-tune: [__reanimator~__](../../objects/reanimator~.md) The `reanimator~` object performs audio texture mapping by analyzing a "texture" sound using spectral analysis (FFT) and then re-synthesizing audio based on a "driver" sound.
- :material-tune: [__pileup~__](../../objects/pileup~.md) The `pileup~` object performs spectral persistence by maintaining amplitude and phase information in frequency bins.
- :material-tune: [__framedelta~__](../../objects/framedelta~.md) The `framedelta~` object calculates the running phase deviation of an FFT analysis.
- :material-tune: [__pvoc.player~__](../../objects/pvoc.player~.md) The `pvoc.player~` object is an audio file player that offers independent time stretching and pitch shifting capabilities through a phase vocoder.
- :material-tune: [__pvoc.live~__](../../objects/pvoc.live~.md) The `pvoc.live~` object performs independent time stretching and pitch shifting on live audio input using granulation.
- :material-tune: [__pvharm~__](../../objects/pvharm~.md) `pvharm~` is an audio harmonizer that transposes an input signal into two pitches.
- :material-tune: [__morph~__](../../objects/morph~.md) The `morph~` object performs a spectral crossfade between the amplitudes and phases of two input signals.
- :material-tune: [__freeze~__](../../objects/freeze~.md) The `freeze~` object captures a spectral snapshot of an incoming audio signal and resynthesizes it using a bank of oscillators, effectively "freezing" the sound.
- :material-tune: [__residency~__](../../objects/residency~.md) The `residency~` object samples audio input into an internal buffer, primarily for spectral processing.
