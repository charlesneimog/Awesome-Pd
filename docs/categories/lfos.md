- :material-tune: [__lfnoise~__](../objects/lfnoise~.md) `lfnoise~` is a low frequency (band limited) noise with or without interpolation.

- :material-tune: [__bl.tri~__](../objects/bl.tri~.md) `bl.tri~` is a triangle oscillator like `else/tri~`, but it is bandlimited.

- :material-tune: [__vibrato~__](../objects/vibrato~.md) `vibrato~` is a pitch shifter abstraction with an LFO controlling the pitch deviation in cents.
.

- :material-tune: [__lores~__](../objects/lores~.md) `lores~` implements an inexpensive resonant lowpass filter.

- :material-tune: [__bl.saw2~__](../objects/bl.saw2~.md) `bl.saw2~` is a sawtooth oscillator like `else/saw2~`, but it is bandlimited.

- :material-tune: [__bl.saw~__](../objects/bl.saw~.md) `bl.saw~` is a sawtooth oscillator like `else/saw~`, but it is bandlimited.

- :material-tune: [__phaser~__](../objects/phaser~.md) `phaser~` is a mono phaser effect abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__lfo__](../objects/lfo.md) `lfo` is a control rate LFO with some common waveforms.
.

- :material-tune: [__rampnoise~__](../objects/rampnoise~.md) `rampnoise~` is a low frequency (band limited) noise generator with interpolation, therefore it ramps from one random value to another, resulting in random ramps.

- :material-tune: [__bl.vsaw~__](../objects/bl.vsaw~.md) `bl.vsaw~` is a variable sawtooth waveform oscillator that also becomes a triangular osccilator just like `else/vsaw~`, but it is bandlimited.

- :material-tune: [__bl.square~__](../objects/bl.square~.md) `bl.square~` is a square oscillator like `else/square~`, but it is bandlimited.
