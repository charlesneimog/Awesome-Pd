# Distortion

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tune: [__drive.m~__](../../objects/drive.m~.md) `drive.m~` is a multichannel audio object that applies a distortion or overdrive effect to incoming audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__crusher.m~__](../../objects/crusher.m~.md) The `crusher.m~` object is a multichannel audio effect that wraps the `crusher~` object from the ELSE library.
- :material-tune: [__digidistort__](../../objects/digidistort.md) The `digidistort` object provides digital distortion effects for audio signals.
- :material-tune: [__lookup~__](../../objects/lookup~.md) The `lookup~` object performs a signal-rate table lookup, mapping input signal values (typically from -1 to 1) to indices within a specified array.
- :material-tune: [__tanh~__](../../objects/tanh~.md) The `tanh~` object calculates the hyperbolic tangent of an input audio signal.
- :material-tune: [__fold~__](../../objects/fold~.md) The `fold~` object performs wavefolding, a waveshaping technique that mirrors audio signals back into a specified low and high range.
- :material-tune: [__shaper~__](../../objects/shaper~.md) The `shaper~` object performs waveshaping by applying a user-defined transfer function to an input signal.
- :material-tune: [__drive~__](../../objects/drive~.md) The `drive~` object in Pure Data simulates analog soft-clipping distortion by applying various non-linear transfer functions.
- :material-tune: [__circuit~__](../../objects/circuit~.md) The `circuit~` object simulates analog electronic circuits from a text description.
- :material-tune: [__crusher~__](../../objects/crusher~.md) The `crusher~` object is an audio effect that performs bit-crushing and decimation on an input signal.
- :material-tune: [__overdrive~__](../../objects/overdrive~.md) The `overdrive~` object simulates analog overdrive by applying a non-linear transfer function to an incoming audio signal, mimicking the soft clipping of a tube-based circuit.
- :material-tune: [__kink~__](../../objects/kink~.md) The `kink~` object distorts a `phasor~` signal by applying a "kink" to its phase.
- :material-tune: [__rm~__](../../objects/rm~.md) The `rm~` object performs ring modulation on an input signal.
