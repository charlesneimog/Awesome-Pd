- :material-tune: [__chorus.m~__](../../objects/chorus.m~.md) The `chorus.m~` object is a wrapper around the `chorus~` object from the ELSE library, designed to apply a chorus audio effect.
- :material-tune: [__chorus~__](../../objects/chorus~.md) `chorus~` is a mono chorus effect that uses an internal comb filter to create a modulated delay.
- :material-tune: [__flanger.m~__](../../objects/flanger.m~.md) `flanger.m~` is a Pure Data audio effect object that serves as a simplified wrapper for the `flanger~` object from the ELSE library.
- :material-tune: [__flanger~__](../../objects/flanger~.md) The `flanger~` object is a simple audio effect that creates a flanging sound.
- :material-tune: [__phaser~__](../../objects/phaser~.md) The `phaser~` object is a mono phaser audio effect.
- :material-tune: [__circuit~__](../../objects/circuit~.md) The `circuit~` object simulates analog electronic circuits from a text description.
- :material-tune: [__phaser.m~__](../../objects/phaser.m~.md) The `phaser.m~` object is a wrapper for the `phaser~` audio effect from the ELSE library.
- :material-tune: [__delay~__](../../objects/delay~.md) The `delay~` object delays an audio signal by a specified number of samples.
