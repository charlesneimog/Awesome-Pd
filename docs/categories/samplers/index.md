# Samplers

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tune: [__tabplayer~__](../../objects/tabplayer~.md) `tabplayer~` is a multichannel array player for Pure Data, designed for flexible audio playback from tables.
- :material-tune: [__grain.sampler~__](../../objects/grain.sampler~.md) The `grain.sampler~` object is a sample-based granulator that generates clouds of audio grains from a loaded sample.
- :material-tune: [__brane.m~__](../../objects/brane.m~.md) The `brane.m~` object is a comprehensive granulator sampler with stretch/compress capabilities and a harmonizer pitch shifter.
- :material-tune: [__sfont.m~__](../../objects/sfont.m~.md) The `sfont.m~` object is a convenient wrapper around `sfont~` designed for soundfont-based synthesis.
- :material-tune: [__gran.player~__](../../objects/gran.player~.md) `gran.player~` is a granular audio player that allows for independent time stretching and pitch shifting of loaded sound files.
- :material-tune: [__sfont~__](../../objects/sfont~.md) `sfont~` is a sampler synthesizer that plays SoundFont (.sf2/.sf3) files, based on FluidLite.
- :material-tune: [__susloop~__](../../objects/susloop~.md) The `susloop~` object generates a control signal for reading audio buffers, specifically designed for sustained looping of a section.
- :material-tune: [__play.file~__](../../objects/play.file~.md) `play.file~` is a Pure Data object that reads and plays audio files from your computer, supporting various formats like AAC, FLAC, MP3, and WAV.
- :material-tune: [__sample~__](../../objects/sample~.md) The `sample~` object creates and manages an audio buffer, enabling users to load, record, save, and manipulate audio samples.
- :material-tune: [__play~__](../../objects/play~.md) The `play~` object plays audio from an array, allowing playback of any segment, at varying speeds (including backwards), and with interpolation.
- :material-tune: [__residency_buffer~__](../../objects/residency_buffer~.md) `residency_buffer~` is an audio object that manages a spectral sample buffer, similar to `residency~`.
- :material-tune: [__sfz~__](../../objects/sfz~.md) The `sfz~` object is a Pure Data synthesizer that plays SFZ instruments, which are text-based definitions for sample-based and hybrid synthesis.
- :material-tune: [__player~__](../../objects/player~.md) `player~` is a versatile Pure Data object for playing back audio files.
