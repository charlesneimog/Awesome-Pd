# Audio IO

- :material-tune: [__out~__](../../objects/out~.md) `out~` is a convenient Pure Data abstraction for managing audio output.
- :material-tune: [__out8~__](../../objects/out8~.md) The `out8~` object is an octaphonic (8-channel) audio output abstraction for Pure Data.
- :material-tune: [__metronome~__](../../objects/metronome~.md) The `metronome~` object generates audio metronome clicks, working in conjunction with the `metronome` control object.
- :material-tune: [__out4~__](../../objects/out4~.md) `out4~` is a quadraphonic audio output abstraction for Pure Data, providing click-free control over DSP on/off, mute, and gain.
- :material-tune: [__setdsp~__](../../objects/setdsp~.md) The `setdsp~` object provides a convenient way to control Pure Data's audio engine (DSP) state.
- :material-tune: [__bl.vsaw~__](../../objects/bl.vsaw~.md) `bl.vsaw~` is a bandlimited variable sawtooth waveform oscillator that can also generate triangular waveforms.
- :material-tune: [__pvgrain~__](../../objects/pvgrain~.md) `pvgrain~` is a spectral granulator that tracks an input sound and synthesizes grains based on its spectral characteristics.
- :material-tune: [__out.mc~__](../../objects/out.mc~.md) The `out.mc~` object routes multichannel audio signals to specified `dac~` output channels, with a default starting channel of 1.
