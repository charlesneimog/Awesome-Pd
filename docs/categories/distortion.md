- :material-tune: [__tanh~__](../objects/tanh~.md) `tanh~` calculates the hyperbolic tangent function of input sample.

- :material-tune: [__shaper~__](../objects/shaper~.md) `shaper~` performs waveshaping with transfer functions, in which signal input values (from -1 to 1) are mapped to the the transfer function's indexes.

- :material-tune: [__xmod~__](../objects/xmod~.md) `xmod~` performs cross modulation of two sine oscillators.

- :material-tune: [__crusher~__](../objects/crusher~.md) `crusher~` is a bit-crusher/reducer and decimator abstraction based on the objects `quantizer~` (mode 4) and `downsample~`, where an input signal quantized and downsampled to generate distortion and aliasing.

- :material-tune: [__filterdelay~__](../objects/filterdelay~.md) `filterdelay~` is a high level delay unit that goes thgouh a resonant lowpass filter, a soft clipper and a DC filter.

- :material-tune: [__power~__](../objects/power~.md) `power~` is a power function waveshaper for signals that extends the usual definition of exponentiation and returns -pow(-a, b) when you have a negative signal input.

- :material-tune: [__fold__](../objects/fold.md) `fold` folds between a low and high value.

- :material-tune: [__rm~__](../objects/rm~.md) `rm~` is a Ring Modulation abstraction.
