- :material-tune: [__tabplayer~__](../objects/tabplayer~.md) `tabplayer~` plays arrays with multichannel support.

- :material-tune: [__grain.sampler~__](../objects/grain.sampler~.md) `grain.sampler~` is a sample based granulator that generates clouds of grains.
.

- :material-tune: [__gran.player~__](../objects/gran.player~.md) `gran.player~` is like `player~` but provides independent time stretching and pitch shifting via granulation (just like `pvoc.player~`).

- :material-tune: [__sfont~__](../objects/sfont~.md) `sfont~` is a sampler synthesizer that plays SoundFont files.

- :material-tune: [__sample~__](../objects/sample~.md) `sample~` is an abstraction that creates an audio buffer which you can use to load a sample or record into.

- :material-tune: [__player~__](../objects/player~.md) `player~` is a convenient abstraction based on `sfload` (so it supports the same file formats, check it's help file) and `tabplayer~`.

- :material-tune: [__pimp~__](../objects/pimp~.md) `pimp~` is very convenient for both driving a process with its phase output (such as reading a sample or envelope) and also triggering at period transitions other objects or processes (such as with `sh~` below).
