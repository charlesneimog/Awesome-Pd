- :material-tune: [__histo__](../objects/histo.md) `histo` records how many times it received a positive integer (no floats allowed).

- :material-tune: [__anal__](../objects/anal.md) `anal` reports how many times it received a number pair.

- :material-tune: [__markov__](../objects/markov.md) `markov` creates Markov chains of any order out of progressions of floats, symbols or lists (which can be used to create polyphonic chains).

- :material-tune: [__histogram__](../objects/histogram.md) `histogram` records into a table how many times it received a positive integer number (treated as indexes, floats are truncated).

- :material-tune: [__rand.dist__](../objects/rand.dist.md) `rand.dist` is an abstraction based on `array quantile` and generates random numbers that follow a probability density function (given by an array).

- :material-tune: [__beat~__](../objects/beat~.md) `beat~` takes an input signal and outputs a detected BPM value.
.

- :material-tune: [__velvet~__](../objects/velvet~.md) `velvet~` is a velvet noise generator, which randomly chooses either positive (1) or negative (-1) impulses at random positions in a given period set in Hz.
