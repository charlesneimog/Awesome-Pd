- :material-tune: [__fdn.rev~__](../objects/fdn.rev~.md) `fdn.rev~` is a feedback delay network reverberator which can be used for late reflections (a.k.a reverb tail).

- :material-tune: [__mono.rev~__](../objects/mono.rev~.md) `mono.rev~` is a reverb abstraction with mono input but stereo output.

- :material-tune: [__echo.rev~__](../objects/echo.rev~.md) `echo.rev~` is an echo/reverb abstraction.

- :material-tune: [__convolve~__](../objects/convolve~.md) `convolve~` is a partitioned impulse response (IR) convolution external for Pure Data.

- :material-tune: [__giga.rev~__](../objects/giga.rev~.md) `giga.rev~` is a stereo reverb in Else based on Juhana Sadeharjuâ€™s *Gigaverb* algorithm, known for producing large, spacious, and dense reverberation tails.

- :material-tune: [__revdelay~__](../objects/revdelay~.md) `revdelay~` is a reverse delay effect.

- :material-tune: [__conv~__](../objects/conv~.md) `conv~` performs partitioned convolution.
