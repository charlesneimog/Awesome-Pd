- :material-tune: [__hello__](../../objects/hello.md) The `hello` object is a simple example external for Pure Data, implemented in Lua and loaded as part of the `else` library.
- :material-tune: [__else__](../../objects/else.md) The `else` object provides information about the ELSE library, including its version, release date, and installation directory.
