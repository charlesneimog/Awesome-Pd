- :material-tune: [__grain.sampler~__](../objects/grain.sampler~.md) `grain.sampler~` is a sample based granulator that generates clouds of grains.
.

- :material-tune: [__gran.player~__](../objects/gran.player~.md) `gran.player~` is like `player~` but provides independent time stretching and pitch shifting via granulation (just like `pvoc.player~`).

- :material-tune: [__plaits~__](../objects/plaits~.md) `plaits~` is a Pure Data external based on the "Plaits" macro-oscillator module by Mutable Instruments.

- :material-tune: [__pitch.shift~__](../objects/pitch.shift~.md) `pitch.shift~` is a pitch shifter abstraction based on granulation.

- :material-tune: [__stretch.shift~__](../objects/stretch.shift~.md) `stretch.shift~` is like `gran.player~`, but for live input.

- :material-tune: [__pvoc.live~__](../objects/pvoc.live~.md) `pvoc.live~` is like `pvoc.player~`, but for live input.
