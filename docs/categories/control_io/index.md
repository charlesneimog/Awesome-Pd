- :material-tune: [__keyboard__](../../objects/keyboard.md) The `keyboard` object provides a graphical piano keyboard interface for Pure Data.
- :material-tune: [__touch.in__](../../objects/touch.in.md) The `touch.in` object extracts MIDI Aftertouch (channel pressure) information from either a connected MIDI device or an external raw MIDI data stream.
- :material-tune: [__circle__](../../objects/circle.md) The `circle` object is a two-dimensional graphical user interface (GUI) slider that represents a circular area.
- :material-tune: [__midi.in__](../../objects/midi.in.md) The `midi.in` object processes incoming MIDI data, converting raw MIDI streams into "cooked" data with type symbols, values, and channel information.
- :material-tune: [__bend.in__](../../objects/bend.in.md) The `bend.in` object extracts MIDI Pitch Bend messages from connected MIDI devices or raw MIDI data streams.
- :material-tune: [__keypress__](../../objects/keypress.md) The `keypress` object detects presses of a single computer keyboard key, outputting a bang or a toggle (1 for pressed, 0 for released).
- :material-tune: [__mousestate__](../../objects/mousestate.md) The `mousestate` object reports the current state of the mouse, including click status, cursor X and Y positions, and delta movement.
- :material-tune: [__pad__](../../objects/pad.md) The `pad` object is a graphical user interface (GUI) element that reports mouse coordinates and click status within its area.
- :material-tune: [__canvas.mouse__](../../objects/canvas.mouse.md) The `canvas.mouse` object captures mouse click status and coordinates within a Pure Data canvas.
- :material-tune: [__numbox~__](../../objects/numbox~.md) The `numbox~` object is a graphical user interface element in Pure Data designed to display and generate audio signal values.
- :material-tune: [__mouse__](../../objects/mouse.md) The `mouse` object captures global mouse interaction within Pure Data.
- :material-tune: [__mousefilter__](../../objects/mousefilter.md) The `mousefilter` object acts as a gate, preventing messages from passing through while a mouse button is held down.
- :material-tune: [__ctl.in__](../../objects/ctl.in.md) The `ctl.in` object extracts MIDI Control Change (CC) messages from either a connected MIDI device or an external raw MIDI data stream.
- :material-tune: [__suspedal__](../../objects/suspedal.md) The `suspedal` object emulates a MIDI sustain pedal, holding `Note Off` messages when active and releasing them when deactivated.
- :material-tune: [__knob__](../../objects/knob.md) The `knob` object is a graphical user interface (GUI) element in Pure Data that functions as a rotary control.
- :material-tune: [__mpe.in__](../../objects/mpe.in.md) The `mpe.in` object processes MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) data, converting raw MIDI input from either an internal device or an external source into structured MPE messages.
- :material-tune: [__midi.learn__](../../objects/midi.learn.md) The `midi.learn` object is a Pure Data abstraction designed to learn and store incoming MIDI data, such as control changes, program changes, notes, and bends.
- :material-tune: [__ptouch.in__](../../objects/ptouch.in.md) `ptouch.in` extracts MIDI polyphonic aftertouch messages from raw MIDI input, such as from a connected MIDI device or an external MIDI data stream.
- :material-tune: [__click__](../../objects/click.md) The `click` object sends a `bang` message when its parent patch (abstraction or subpatch) is clicked.
- :material-tune: [__keymap__](../../objects/keymap.md) The `keymap` object translates computer keyboard presses into MIDI note on/off messages, effectively turning your QWERTY keyboard into a musical input device.
- :material-tune: [__keycode__](../../objects/keycode.md) The `keycode` object provides layout-independent keyboard input, outputting a numerical key code based on the physical key location.
- :material-tune: [__lpt__](../../objects/lpt.md) The `lpt` object in Pure Data allows writing and reading data to and from a computer's parallel port.
